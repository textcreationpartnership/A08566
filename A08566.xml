            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And for this it is the more to be merueyled at, that they liue vnder one lawe, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly affected: ſo that there ſeemeth to bee no occaſion of theire eygre ſtrife and contentious dealinge. For in thys one poincte which merueylouſly encreaſeth mutuall loue and amity, both of them, accorde together, that is in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge their country, and they altogether want that which cauſeth great diſcorde and enmity in the common wealth.

And when the peoples mindes are poyſoned with al kind of miſchife, riot, &amp; exceſſe, no lawes, no authority, no feare of puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may ſtay their furious, &amp; heady enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices: neyther any reaſon may perſwade them, but that one time or other, they will deſperately breake out to the vtter vndoinge of their Natiue Countrye.

I cannot but meruayle in the meane whyle, what moueth many men to make ſo great accompte of their gentilitye, that they thincke theym ſelues worthye of ſuche honoure and eſtimation. For either Nobility by nature hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, or preheminence annexed thereunto, or els y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parte of thoſe who commonlye are tearmed Noble &amp; of gentle bloude (whoſe myndes are infected with manye maladies) come nothinge neare to true Nobilitye. For it were not to be doubted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but if Nobility were knowen by exerciſinge it ſelfe in ſome notable exploite deſeruinge due prayſe and commendation, it would ſtirre vp the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of a greate many to embrace and loue the excellencye thereof: in ſo mutch that all men woulde willingely obey the lawes, and ſubmit theymſelues to the aucthoritye of their ſuperiours.

I haue thought it therefore muſt appertynent to my purpoſe, to ſearch out diligently the nature, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, right rule, and foundation of true Nobilitye, &amp; the

But whereas this name of Nobility is, many and ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry wayes to be interpreted, that onely will I touche, whiche impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the worthines and dignity of Noble Parentage.</p>
               <p>THe firſt thinge that may be queſtioned of, is to knowe whether that Nobilitye may be accompted amongeſt thoſe thinges, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deſerue honour &amp; eſtimation. For we may alledge many argumentes, whiche maye ſeeme to proue, that the Noblenes of byrth and worthines of Parentage, may neither conteine in it ſelfe anye ſuperioritye, neither by any meanes to be reduced to thoſe thinges, which in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelus are tearmed good. For as mutch as apperteineth to our nature, and the common courſe of wordly welth, wée cannot conceiue what gaine may growe, by this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhewe &amp; admiration of Princelye porte. For as ſoone as we entre into this life full of lamentation and miſerye, we are all ruled &amp; gouerned by the ſame kinde of lawes, neither is any man exempted and ſet free from an infinite heape of miſeries, wherewith the condition and eſtate of mortal men is afflicted, wee therefore make our firſt entrie into life, with blubberinge teares, and bitternes of ſorow, wee from our natiuity are wrapped in woe and miſery, wée ſighe in ſobbes, and liue in lamentation, and wée in the ende dolefully draw to death, through the continual afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mutch perturbation. But ſo farre of from Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is it to be preſerued from ſuch plagues and ſcourges, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mutch more ſlippery and daungerous is that eſtate, &amp; the ende more intermedled with miſchiefe and miſery, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other eſtate of mankinde whatſoeuer. For as euery va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour

But if any man ponder &amp; weyghe in his mynde the natural qualities of the body, in the ſame true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall he finde nothinge whye noble bloude ſhoulde bee preferred before baſe Parentage. For neither is he whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is of gentle bloude more valiant then hee, which is of lowe degre, neyther in his race more ſwyfte, neyther yet in health more luſty, and of greater force. Nay rather the more daintily be feedeth, the weaker is his body made, the more apte to be troubled with extreme payne, in any kynd of infirmity. If then the caſe ſtandeth thus, that neither the fauour of fortune, nor the comely feature of the bodye diſtinguiſſheth man from man, and as it were by diſtincte offices deuideth them, then no doubt the diuerſity of man hys eſtate is knowen manifeſtlye by the qualities of the minde, or els it is no place els where to be founde. For the perfect ſhew of Nobility is to be ſeene by one of theſe thre vertues, beſides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which there is none whereby it may be perceiued. But whereas wee ſee the pathwaye to vertue open vnto al men, and that Gentlemen deſcendinge of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable families geue themſelues to all impietye, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lowe and ſimple parentage excelleth the reſt in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, vertue, and integritye of life: me thinketh therefore that, that Nobility which is generally ſo mutch aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced is but vayne, and grounded onely vppon the vnconſtancye of peoples phantaſie. Theſe thinges no doubt may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected againſt the worthines of noble Parentage. But yet wée muſt thincke it to be for ſome great cauſe, that all men willingly do yelde the Souerainty to ſomeone houſe and progeny ſo that the generall conſente and agremente of all countries is to be taken for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe of nature. Which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13981:12"/> thinge that wée may perceaue more playnly, I will begin with nature her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>VVHoſoeuer therefore wyll intentiuelye behoulde the woonderfull woorcke of Nature, and the degree of al liuinge creatures, ſhal finde that euery thinge is not of like qualitye, but that ſome one thinge in excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of nature exceedeth other, and ſome other thinge yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto other, in eſtimation and dignity. For ſo meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly nature hath wrought in her creatures, that euen as they one in forme and ſhape differ from a nother, ſo they ſhould in like manner be diſpoſed diuerſly, and not endued with the like power and vertue: in ſo mutche that ſome ſhoulde moue, other bee moued, ſome rule, other willinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey. Pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipally therfore if you will more deapely pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this matter, and aduiſedly waygh the gloryous hue of Heauenly conſtitution, you ſhall vnderſtande the partes thereof not to be of like worthines, or endued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame beauty and ſeemelynes. For it is moſt apparant that the Starres obſerue not the ſome courſe, neyther are of like proportion, neyther of like operation, in ſo mutch that by their influences wée ſee the one as it were to haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynion ouer the other, and to receaue of the partes more excellent and predomina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t light, power, and vertue.

To deſcend to the Earth and the creatures therof, what needeth it to diſcourſe howe diuerſly they are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Are they of one nature, are they all endued with the ſame quality and vertue? Neyther is this difference to be

For trees which are of one kynde ſpreadeth not their braunches in like fayrenes, nor euery Stede doth his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire wtih the lyke loftines, neither euery Lion is of lyke ſtrength. Finally in al the worckes of nature, there is to be noted ſome variety and alteration of degree, place, and dignity. This excellency of nature neuer decayeth in the thinges that be euerlaſtinge, but in the thinges which for a time doe floriſhe, nature moſt ſecretly throughe the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the parent conueigheth to poſterity accordinge to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayinge of that worthy Poete.</p>

Of this honourable order there are two kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. The one is generall, apperteininge to a whole Citty, the other ſpeciall and concerneth any priuate family.

The ſelfe ſame rule is obſerued in euery priuate familye. For that houſe excedeth other in honour and nobility, from whence hath iſſued and deſcended a greater company of renoumed perſonages. Wherby it foloweth that the force of vertue is found as excedinge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one, as in the other: onely this is the difference, the one is priuate, the other is publique. To exemplefie thys ſecond poincte we haue reade of the Noble houſe of the <hi>Fabians,</hi> of the <hi>Claudians,</hi> of the <hi>Scipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oes,</hi> and <hi>Cornelians,</hi> all which haue beene honoured in all poſterity for their prowes and magnanimity.

<pb facs="tcp:13981:15"/> and honourable, which wanteth eyther of them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet is. It may not be therefore that in a blinde, and obſcure Citty there ſhould be a family of any fame (for were it not a thinge incredible, that ſuch a commonwealth ſhould be obſcure &amp; as it were ouerſhadowed with darkenes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there dwelleth ſutch a one, as may be tearmed a lighte of moſt deuine and reſplendent vertue, for ſo it ſhould bee accoumted not barbarous but famous) neither yf there were in that commonwealth a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber neuer ſo exceadinge fraight with eſpeciall vertues, yet could he come foorth to light, and chalenge due deſerued dignity and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhakinge of the cloudy miſtines, wherewith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole countrie was ouerwhelmed. Therefore the chyefeſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that nature can beſtowe on vs, is to be borne and brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte vp in a country in fame and glory, the next good gifte of nature is to bringe owr deſcent from ſome noble linage and worthy parentage. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his aunſwere to <hi>Tymodeus Aphydneus,</hi> moſt fitely agreeth to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: To whom it was diſdainfully obiected that he was not through his owne vertues ſo mutch honoured of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> but onely for that he was borne an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi> Thowe haſt ſayde, ꝙ <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> for neyther I my ſelfe if I had bene borne in thy countrey <hi>Aphydnum,</hi> coulde euer attayne ſo greate renoume and glory, neither thou if <hi>Athens</hi> had bene thy countrey couldeſt thereby at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiue to the title of honour and dignity. Which may in this manner be applyed. For he which is obſcurely borne and of low degrée may not throughe the worthines of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place be made noble, neither any of gentle bloude ſhall haue yelded vnto hym eſtymation dewe to hys byrthe and eſtate in a barbarous and obſcure Citty. Noble men therefore haue their due honoures, in their owne manour houſes and country. But perfecte and true nobility is not chaungeable through the alteration of place, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it hath his beinge, and is déepely rooted and printed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13981:15"/> in mens myndes, it is of all men honoured and magnified a like. For what is hee amongeſt the <hi>Romaines</hi> (at what time the eſtate of that renoumed Citty floriſhed in all prowes and Nobilitye) that hadde in admiration, or made any accompt of the Princes of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> or <hi>Bythinia?</hi> On the other ſide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Barbarians</hi> did magnify the <hi>Romains</hi> as Gods. Therefore nobility may alſo be deuided in this maner. The one moſt abſolute and floriſhinge in al natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the other tyed to the place from whence it firſt proceded. This nobility therefore ſheweth her ſelfe no farther forth then the boundes of his natiue countrey will ſtreach, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaynely of the people commended, then deſeruedlye honoured: But that nobility beautified with the glory of Princely parentage euery where and amonge al men ſhal haue deſerued reuerence.

It is a thinge therefore moſt nedefull that ſome ſhoulde beare rule &amp; ſit in the place of maieſty, by whoſe wiſedome and pollicye the multitude ſhould be gouerned, other ſome ſhould geue them ſelues to warlike practiſes, or to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning in ſome ſcience through the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they mighte in diſtreſſe and daunger be a ſtaye to theyr countrye, other till the ground, other worke at annile, all to the commoditie of their natiue countrie. Whereas then it is very requiſite that men ſhould differ in degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; dignitie, in labour &amp; induſtrie, Nature hath prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wrought the varietie of witts, of diſpoſitions, &amp; qualities.

Who through their good conſtellacion may both wiſely forſee daunger, and couragiouſly repell imminente miſchiefe. <hi>Socrates</hi> in the Booke entituled <hi>Phaedro,</hi> calleth this excellency of Nature the gould of the Gods, whereby he is indured to thincke that they whoſe mindes are thus beautifyed, are vnto them allyed, and fitte of all other to be placed on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13981:17"/> the earth in the Throne of Maieſtie. Dame Nature therefore the mother of all things, hath placed them prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in higheſt roome of dignitie. Other ſome ſhe hath not framed in ſuch perfite wiſe, either for witte, proweſſe, and valiauntnes, yet hath ſhee imparted vnto them greate ſtrength and much courage, in ſo much they will not eaſly fainte, but manfully obſeruinge lawes and ordinaunces, and aide their country in time of daunger. Other ſhe hath made more ſimple of vnderſtandinge, more coulde of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and therefore iuſtly hath appointed them to toyle in ſeruile Artes, of which ſort are they whom we terme men of occupation. For ſo it is brought to paſſe by the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence of God, that whereas ech man helpeth an other, and laboureth in the Vocation wherunto he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the eſtate of man kinde is thereby happely preſerued. And the diuerſitie of man his inclination and diſpoſition was knowen euen from that time when men as <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> wandered in woods and deſolate places, voyde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and all good ciuilitie. For at that time ſome one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the reſt excelling in witte, knowledge, and induſtrie, withdrew them through great perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s from rudenes, to ciuill gouernment, from barbarouſnes, to all maner of gentlenes. The which thing the beſt learned haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs vnder fictions and Poets tales.

Whereby, it is geuen vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that thoſe men which for want of vnderſtanding were as blunte as blocks, were wonne by wyſedome, and brought by the pollicie of other to much ciuility. By ſuch a deede <hi>Theſeus</hi> wanne great fame &amp; immortall memory. Who firſt aſſembled into one place the people of <hi>Athens</hi> miſerablye deuided, geeuinge them profitable lawes and
<pb facs="tcp:13981:18"/> good ordinaunces. I will in meane time let to ſpeake of thoſe, who were longe before <hi>Theſeus,</hi> whiche erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and builded many Citties. Then was it to bee ſeene howe much the gentlemanlike and Princely mynde was preferred before the baſe and abiecte courage. In thoſe vertue was ſo much loued and merueyled at, that they which had receyued ſo greate benefite by ſuch which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in vertue and honeſtye, yelded themſelues with all ſubmiſſion to be ruled by their wyſdome, in ſo much that when they were deade, they gaue vnto them deuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noures, and embraced wyth entyre loue, theyr children and ofſpring. Principally they were moued therevnto, for that their benefites were freſhe in memorye, which were ſo great and many, that of deutye they thought to render thanckes to theyr poſteritye. When afterwardes they founde, and had experienſed, that there was in the iſſue the true and liuely image of the parente, not to be ſeene ſo much in the feature and makinge of the bodye, as in the qualitye and diſpoſition of the mynde, then they were ſtyrred vp excedingly, not onely for the loue that they bare to theyr aunceſtours, as for the eſpeciall regarde that they had to the Noble diſpoſitions of their progeny, to honour that ſtocke and family, to whom they did offer the ſwaye and gouernment of the common wealth moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglye. If then any man will demaunde at what tyme Gentilitye firſt began, hee is to learne, that then it firſte entred, when men oute of order were reduced to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the perſwaſion and pollicie of ſuch, as were endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the excellency of good Nature and noble bloud.

               <p>What maye be gathered of this alſo that <hi>Tlepolemus</hi> did with ſuch bitter nippes reuile <hi>Sarpedon</hi> of <hi>Lycia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge daungerouſly aſſaulted in the fronte of his enemies, becauſe hee fayned himſelfe falſely to be the ſonne of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter:</hi> who cleared himſelfe of that vayne vaunte not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in woorde but in deede alſo, when as hee vanquiſhed and ſlue <hi>Tlepolemus,</hi> a valiaunt and worthy wight the ſonne of <hi>Hercules.</hi> For there was no ſuch waye for him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte his countenaunce, and to ſhew the worthines of his birth, as by vanquiſhing ſo ſtronge and valiaunte a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. But ſome man will ſaye, whereto ſerueth it that you tell vs ſo manye and ſondry deſcents of Gods, and to mingle your matter with ſo many fayned inuentions, and forged fables of Poets in a caſe that requireth nought els to be alleaged but ſimple trothe. In all that <hi>Homer</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:13981:19"/> wrote (that we leaue other vntouched) there is no thinge to be ſeene or read, that may not be thoughte very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and worthye to be reiected of all men vtterly: In whom you ſhall finde the Gods lamenting and howlinge miſerably, great vprores and ſeditions ſtirred in heauen it ſelfe, great miſchiefes committed, many as the Goddes appointed, nay rather in deſpite of the Gods, cruelly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, pitifully plagued, and ſlaine. It maye ſeeme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a thing moſt vnfitt to enterlace the vaine phantaſies of Poets with the ſimple and plaine reaſons of Philoſophers. This I ſay may bee obiected vnto mee. But if I maye be ſuffred ſome thinge to digreſſe and goe from the matter, I will aunſwere eaſlie, by diſputinge brieflie of the ſtudie of humanitie, theſe weake and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſſertions. And ſo much the rather I am moued thereunto, for that I often vſe the auctoritie of <hi>Homer.</hi> I am truly of this opinion, that all Poets are ſworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to lies, and do vtterly deteſt falſehode: but amongſt the reſte <hi>Homer</hi> eſpecially was the ſearcher and louer of all truth and veritye. Which opinion the moſt noble and wyſe ſages of Greece haue ratifyed, what time as by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the counſell of <hi>Homer</hi> contayned in two Verſes, they yelded vp a right vnto the men of <hi>Athens</hi> being then at greate ſtrife wyth the <hi>Megarenſes</hi> aboute the title and poſſeſſion of <hi>Salaminia.</hi> Men of greate learninge and iudgemente were of this minde, whoſe monumentes and woorkes are garniſhed with the highe and ſtately ſtyle of <hi>Homers</hi> inuention: I ſaye all ſuch which excelled the reſt in witte, in eloquence and learninge fully accorded in this opinion. Neither is it expediente (which thoſe moſt wiſe, good, and experte men knewe righte well) that in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian and Poet, the like euidence of troth is to be loked for. For in Hiſtories are onely ſet out the worthy actes of valiaunt men, that they ſhould thereby liue in perpetuall
<pb facs="tcp:13981:20"/> memory. But Poets whoſe maner of wryting is farre vnlike, many times applyeth themſelues to the eares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure. The chiefeſte thinge therefore that commendeth an Hiſtorian is to deſcribe plainly, all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie being ſet a part, the acte of what Nature ſoeuer it be, limited with circumſtaunce of place, perſon, and time. But a Poeticall deſcription as it is moſt tyed to nomber and feete, ſo the diſcourſe thereof hath a greater licence &amp; libertie. And yet there is a kinde of truth looked for at their hands, which if they doe not conningly declare, they are not onely of the learned iudged ignoraunte, but of all men condemned and cryed oute vppon. The dutie therfore and parte of a Poet is no leſſe truly, then trimly, not leſſe vnfainedly, then finely, no leſſe approuedly, then pikedly, as wyth a penſile to deſcribe the maners of men, to deſcrie the fromphes of Fortune, and the whole eſtate and condition of mans life. Againe, to ſet forth elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in moſt decent ſort, the Nature of honeſtie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the deformitie of ſinne and impietie, what is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced &amp; followed, what to bee deteſted vtterly &amp; abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Whoſoeuer then wil take vpon him ſo great &amp; hard an enterpriſe, and can ſo acquite himſelfe thereof that hee maye be thoughte to haue omitted no one pointe of a good Poet, the ſame is not to be condemned as an vntrue ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, but comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded highly as a Deuine &amp; learned writer. For who is he of ſo ſimple a witte and iudgemente that in reading the wandringes and doubtfull viages of <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> ſixe hundred ſhipwracks, the great golfe and ſwallowing ſourge of <hi>Charibdis,</hi> the roaring of <hi>Scilla,</hi> the daunger in auoyding <hi>Antiphates,</hi> the greeuous conflict which he had wyth <hi>Polyphemus:</hi> who is hee, (I ſay) ſo beſide himſelfe that will thincke thoſe thinges ſo ſet downe and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Homer,</hi> as if they were to bee beleeued or mighte come to paſſe by any poſſibilitie. And yet men excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well learned haue wondered at him for his deepe iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13981:20"/> and deuine witte, whoe did expreſſe ſo liuely the true &amp; perfect image of Vertue, which would be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by no terror, allured by no wanton entiſements, pine for no peril, languiſh and faynte for no woe and miſerye. In this maner <hi>Achilles</hi> is gazed on as the glorious i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of puiſſance and magnanimitie. In this wyſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> is accompted moſt noble for his wyſedome and polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Neither hath hee deſcribed theſe thinges roughly, or in a crabbed ſtyle, thereby to tyre and loth the reader, which maner of wrytinge Philoſophers vſe, but wyth a wonderfull, or rather with a philed phraſe of deuine elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the rather to allure men to the ſtudy and exerciſe of vertue and honeſtie. What is hee then that can charge or ſteine <hi>Homer</hi> wyth the blot of vntrothe, whereas hee hath perfourmed with ſuch perfection the thinge, which was at his handes in that matter required. If then at any time we alledge him for auctority, wee do it wholy for this intente, to imitate as neere as wee maye him, who throughe the ſharpenes of his deuine witte and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was able fully to conſider of euery matter, and perce the ſecretes of all things. Truly not for that ende, that I did beleeue thoſe thinges to be true, as they were ſet downe by him, but that ſuch in deede I ſuppoſed to bee the maners of men, ſuch to be the Lawes and ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of Countryes, ſuch to be the nature and force of thinges, and al other matters to be of the like ſorte and condicion, as they were by him in wrytinge declared. Wherefore (to come to my former treatiſe of Nobilitie) in that hee doth by wryting expreſſe <hi>Achilles</hi> to be the ſonne of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Memnon</hi> of <hi>Aurora,</hi> and <hi>Sarpedon</hi> of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> his meaninge no doubte agreeth with the minde and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all wyſe men of that time, that they who for wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vertue, did farre excell the reſt, might be iudged not without the eſpeciall prouidence of the Gods to haue
<pb facs="tcp:13981:21"/> bene bore, and therefore to haue bene of their linage, and conſanguinity. And this was the chiefe cauſe that <hi>Theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was thought to haue beene the ſonne of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> borne of the God <hi>Mars. Alexander</hi> alſo the greate did longe time ſince delight to bee called the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which opinion alſo grue of <hi>Scipio Affrican.</hi> For the ſelf ſame rumour which was rayſed before of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> was vainely bruted of <hi>Scipio,</hi> which was, that a Serpent in ſhape monſtruous, was oftentimes ſeene in his mothers chamber. Which beinge once of many men euidently noted, ſodainly vaniſhed, and was ſeene no more. Herehence aroſe this opinion, that many did thincke that <hi>Scipio</hi> his mother was great and conceaued by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente a child. But you wil ſay, O notable &amp; ſhameles lie. I pray you is there any man ſo voide of wit, reaſon, and vnderſtandinge, or ſo farre from the fayth of Chriſt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wilbe perſwaded that theſe thinges are true? But yet this lie is grounded on a true and good opinyon, which is, to thincke that the nobilitye of bloude iſſueth from the excellency of good nature, and that the worthines of vertue proceadeth from ſome noble and Princely paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Hereby it is euident, and moſt playne, and many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, howe greatly men of auncient memory dyd eſteeme gentle and noble families. Verely not without good cauſe. For if any thinge were, that for the worthines thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued perpetuall and euerlaſtinge memory, it iſſued from thoſe noble perſonages for the moſt part: As it is a thing moſt cleare and euident to him, that liſteth to reade the reportes and commentaries of antiquity. Who knoweth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſtocke of <hi>Hercules</hi> ſo farre excelled other in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and vertue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it did eaſely ſubdue the force and power of the <hi>Pelopidanes</hi> and wonderfully ſtrengthened the ſtate of <hi>Athens,</hi> readye to bee ouerronne and deſtroyed vtterly. So greately was any noble familye eſteemed, that who ſo were deſcended by them, did thinke they were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13981:21"/> protected by the power of ſome heauenly garriſon. What auaileth it to ſhew you of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtocke &amp; noble line of <hi>Perſeus?</hi> Or what ſhould it ſkill to recite the worthy Actes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous enterpriſes of ſuche, as haue beene of the race of <hi>Aeacus?</hi> If any one woulde call to minde howe many and how great affayres, howe ſtraunge and howe daungerous enterprices haue bene done &amp; wrought by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſhould vnderſtand for the moſt parte that nothinge hath ben amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, or acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed, but by ſuch, whoſe progenitors were in their life honourable, whoſe progenye after their death were honoured of the people. To omit to ſpeake of Kinges and Princes whom euerye man knowes to haue béene of ſingular vertues, whoſe fame was ſounded farre and wyde, truely <hi>Cliſthenes,</hi> who firſt wrought the ruin and vtter ſubuerſion of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous gouernment, <hi>Myltiades, Cimon, Themiſtocles, Pericles,</hi> and many moe, whome to recite were ouer tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whoe tooke vppon them moſte weighty affayres and harde enterprices, as well againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> all thoſe for the moſt parte came of ſome noble line and princely parentage. The like is to be founde amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> the men of <hi>Sparta</hi> and a numbre of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations and countries beſides. But let vs leaue theſe foraigne and ſtraunge examples, and ſearch the Hiſtories of our owne tyme. If you geue your ſelfe to the readinge of holye ſcripture, you ſhall haue therein conteyned what great oddes there is betwixt man and man, and finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies there ſpecified in confirmation, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true nobility. And that I leaue other vnſpoken of it is apparent that the ſtocke of <hi>Iuda</hi> did farre excel the <hi>Hebrue</hi> Nation in vertue, honour, and dignity. Who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time they were happely deliuered from the thraldome and ſlauerye they ſuſteyned amongeſt the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> haue bene well approued for their greate vertue and godlines. Amongeſt whom I will onely note vnto youe certaine.
<pb facs="tcp:13981:22"/> What time the <hi>Egiptian</hi> Kinge did greuouſly torment the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> neither woulde vppon any condition releaſe them as God had geuen them commaundement, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſed their miſery dayely more &amp; more: At the length accordinge to his deſert ſuffered iuſt puniſhment, at what time God him ſelfe appeared vnto him. For their la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des were waſted, their fruicts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed through a great and terrible plague, then by the verye appoyntmente of God mutch bloude ſhed, great cruelty committed, all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie practiſed. In concluſion the kinge being as it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare well reclaimed by ſo many greuous &amp; bitter ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, permitted the <hi>Hebrues</hi> to departe to offer ſacrifice. The <hi>Hebrues</hi> then departinge therehence, and pitchinge their tentes neere the read ſea, perceaued ſome miſchife imagined againſt them, otherwiſe then they looked for. For as ſone as they paſſed the boundes of <hi>Egipt,</hi> it repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the kinge much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ſet them at libertye. For he beinge puffed vp with great pride did perſeuere in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wickednes, in ſo mutch he purpoſed to purſue them with great force, notwithſtandinge knowinge them to be protected by the hande of Almightie God. For whereas he was vtterly ouerwhelmed with the outrage of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, coulde not perceaue what plagues were appoincted readye to confounde hym and his people, he prepareth therfore a great troupe of horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, multitudes of footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are muſtered, and all delay beinge ſet a ſide hee bendeth his mayne force agaynſt the <hi>Hebrues.</hi> At that inſtante <hi>Moyſes</hi> beſought God with earneſt prayer and petition for the peace, and the happy deliuerance of his people, and with that rodde which repreſented the omnipotent power of Almighty God, which he alwayes carried about with him ſtryketh the <hi>Sea,</hi> and immediatly he made a wide and open way for them through the middeſt thereof. For the <hi>Sea</hi> beinge ſubiect and obedient to the will and power of God, was vnto them in both ſides as a ſtronge wall, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13981:22"/> mighty fortreſſe, whereby they did ſecurely paſſe witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> feare of imminente daunger. Notwythſtandynge ſo greate was the feare of thoſe <hi>Hebrues</hi> (as it is reported in certaine hiſtories of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for holy ſcripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thereof at al no mention) they report therefore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch was their horrour &amp; dread, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> albeit they were aſſiſted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God, yet with great adoe were they brought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them ſelues to the daungerous paſſage of water. Moreouer it is verified, that they whiche diſcended from <hi>Iuda,</hi> did manifeſtly ſhewe foorth a great experiment of puiſſance and valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnes, who lingred not or drewe backe, but by the example of <hi>Moyſes</hi> with merueylous conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye aduentured firſte the <hi>Sea,</hi> and by their ſtoute ſtomach encouraged the reſt to folowe them. But what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that great and notable confuſion, wherein the wicked and damnable Kinge, hauinge his minde poyſoned with moſte deadely rancoure, and beinge blinded with moſte horrible impiety raſhely aduentured to paſſe through the <hi>Sea,</hi> and was with all his armye ſwallowed vp with the ſurges and gulfes of the ſame. Was not this people of <hi>Iuda</hi> euer afterwardes more honoured then the reſt, for their manly courage and valiaunt harte? therevppon it was decreed that among the twelue rulers and Princes (for oute of ſeuerall trybes were elected diuers Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes) hee ſhoulde haue the ſoueraignetie whiche diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from the Trybe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> hee ſhoulde conducte the hooſte, he ſhoulde make peace, he ſhould firſte offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, his rule and aucthority the reſt did obey. Wherby it is moſt playnly &amp; euidentlye gathered that <hi>Moyſes</hi> had conſideration of the noblenes of bloud and nature, in that he aſſigneth vnto one peculiar people the title and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of honoure and dignity.

He was of that mynde that hee woulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe his daughter (beyng very bewtifull) vppon no man in mariage, except on him whiche coulde ſubdue a ſtrong and mighty citye of his enemyes: and in fine, his brothers ſonne vanquiſhed the ſame.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13981:23"/> noblenes whiche I haue ſet down, be euident &amp; true, there is no doubt then, but that the ſtocke and trybe of <hi>Iuda</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue attayned the perfection of honour and ſoueraigntie. From thence ſprang vp a nombre of noble captaynes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence iſſued out moſt wiſe and prudent fathers, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence proceded many excellent men for equitye &amp; iuſtice, from<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence hath diſcended kinges and princes righte worthye and honourable, and emongeſt the reſt (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I paſſe ouer wyth ſilence) the moſt noble and holye Kinge <hi>Dauid,</hi> a myrroure and ſpectacle of all vertue and godlines.

               <p>NOwe I haue to my ſimple ſkill ſhewed ſufficientlye the firſt grounde and originall of nobility, deriuynge
<pb facs="tcp:13981:24"/> the foundation thereof from that good inclination whiche is through the benefite of nature printed in haughty min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des which yf it happely grew and by continuance of tyme come to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it bringeth forth that noblenes of birth and parentage, whych euery where is ſo muche eſteemed and honoured. For it is a thing worthye to be noted (that we ſpeake ſom thinge of this alſo) how muche antiquitye ſetteth foorth the glorye and dignitye of true nobility as a greate profe &amp; confirmation, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimony wherof-al worthy actes and noble enterpryſes are committed and commended to poſterity. For thoſe thinges which for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of memory haue almoſt bene forgotten, are moſt highlye of vs eſteemed, ſo that we do much more admire them for theyr prowes and vallantnes, then that we ſuppoſe many of our tyme not able wyth al labour and induſtrie to enſue and imitate. Herehence doth ariſe that great emulation recorded in auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hiſtorys) betwene nation &amp; natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, while ſome do vaunt themſelues to haue beene beyonde all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, agayne other ſeeke to draw al renowne of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye to themſelues.

What ſhall I ſay of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi> whoe did attribute ſo much vnto themſelues for the glory and title of antiquitie, that they thought themſelus onely by that name of righte moſte worthye to rule all Greece. For whereas the firſte beginninges of other partes of Greece were regeſtred either in ſome memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chronicle, either in ſome worthy monumente: onely the beginning and originall of the <hi>Athenians</hi> could by no ſteppes of auncient deſcente euidently be traced oute.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13981:24"/> firſte of the ſoyle of that lande, and came not together through the aſſembling and meeting of any other people, but euermore from their generation enhabited their owne and natiue country. And for that cauſe they adorne their heade wyth fine nets or caules garniſhed and wroughte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Graſhoppers of Gould: ſignifyinge that as Graſhoppers are engendred of the ſoyle where they are firſt found, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Athenians</hi> came naturally from the place they do inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite. For which cauſe they were called the ofſpring of their owne lande. They were therefore deſirous of two names, as well to ſhewe and manifeſte that there was nothinge to bee founde in their aunceſtours that was borrowed of Barbarians and ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, as alſo to the end, they would be knowen to excel all other Nations for the prerogatiue of their antiquitie. Wee alſo ſee in priuate ſtockes and families howe greatly it auayleth them which ſtande on the pointe of their petegree to ſhewe the Records of their Seignorie. For it ſemeth a thing moſt reaſonable, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee denyed that thoſe families are of more honour, whoe haue a longer time ſupported their countenaunce by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honeſtie. And this is the cauſe that vpſtarte gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are ſo litle regarded. Which opprobrious diſdain commonlye proceedeth from a contemptuous and proude ſtomach, and an vntollerable loftines, and yet not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voide of good reaſon. For albeit Gentlemen which haue bene lately promoted, excel in vertue, wit, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, yet doe not they cary with them ſuch credit, yet haue they not that hore heade, whych eſpecially in greate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and noble bloude is to be eſtemed and honoured. For euen as we doe chiefely reuerence graye heares, and elder years, euen ſo the auncient race of nobility ſhoulde beare the ſway, porte, and aucthority. In whiche opinion not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge certaine bondes and limittes are to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For as feeble and weake olde age doth impayre the force of reaſon, of memory, and vnderſtandinge, and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

               <p>VVHereas the glory &amp; dignity of true nobilitye hath bene declared by me with many excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ornamentes annexed thereunto, it remaineth to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For it may ſeeme vnto many a thinge moſt vniuſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides reaſon, that whereas all men are by nature deſirous of liberty, and voide of the yoke of bondage, they ſhoulde be reſtreined of theyr freedome, and ſhoulde be forced by lawes to obey others, and not folow their owne will and pleaſure: eſpecially whereas men of honour and highe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for the moſt parte do moſt inſolently abuſe their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, both through pride, and ambition, and are founde captaines to all miſchiefe and cruelty. But that I maye more plainly expreſſe the ſame, it is to be conſidered not ſo mutch that which may augment the weale of any priuate perſon, but rather that which may enrich the ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and preſerue the ſame in wealth and felicity. For looke what thinge ſoeuer apperteineth to the preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and welfare of all men, muſt nedes be thought profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to euery ſingular man and peculiar perſon For it may not be that any one parte or member of a common weale ſhoulde be ſounde and perfect, where the whole body ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is greuouſly afflicted and annoyed. But if any one part and member of a commonweale bee greatly oppreſſed, ſo longe as the eſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole be ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de &amp; perfect, it may the ſouer be reſtored to his former felicity. But that we may

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moſt noble and honourable. <hi>Athens,</hi> after the death of Kinge <hi>Codrus</hi> was happely preſerued by the lawes and ordinaunces which <hi>Solon</hi> made, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of many excelling in wit &amp; learni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people péeres, &amp; gaue to ſubiects ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnety &amp; vnto the multitude ouer much liberty. The eſtate of that commonweale was ſufficientely hereby argued of what time within the compaſſe of xl yeares the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſpoyled by the wilfulnes of the people, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſelfe ſubiect to the tyranny of <hi>Pyſiſtratus.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they had ſet them ſelues at liberty againe, and were no more ſubiect to the tyranny of Princes, a greate number of yeares both in <hi>Greece,</hi> and in the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia</hi> they held the ſoueraignety, rule, and gouerment. Whiche power, and principality was ſone tottered and brought to ruin, through the intollerable pryde and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſome who ſought to féede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humoures of others, and to be accoumpted people pleaſers. Amongeſt whom <hi>Pericles</hi> is named, who although he did excell in <hi>Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and was wondred at for his ſwéete tongue &amp; fine vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and was ſkyllfull in gouernment, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge did not ſée what miſchiefe he brought to the country when he made equal the Prince which the people, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes with Nobility, and by that meanes confoundinge eſtates together, did violate and breake the aucthoritie of <hi>Areopagus.</hi> For no other thinge is it, to make equall in liberty, the Nobles and common fort of men, then to geue weapons to vnbridled rage &amp; luſt, whereby it may worcke all maner of miſchiefe. But will you ſee what euell and miſery enſued, when the commonwealth was ruled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wil and pleaſure of the people? Firſt a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſcourge and miſerable deſtruction was ſaide on the neckes of men for life and vertue approued, (whiche had
<pb facs="tcp:13981:26"/> preſerued and increaſed the weale publique) by obſcure men and diſpoſed to al kinde of villanny. For in the whole commonwealth of <hi>Athens</hi> after the eſtate thereof was miſerably rent in peeces, no one was to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, whiche was moued with the loue of vertue, agayne which did not conceiue hatred and indignation, againſte his wretched, and vngratfull country. Where at length the myſerye grewe ſo great and violent, that ſome were openly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and vtterly ſpoyled of their goods and poſſeſſions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome baniſhed, many ſlayne and put to cruell death, who had in their liues throughe great vertue and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, victoriouſly conquered the enemy, nobly defended theyr countrye. This calamity was great and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the body of the weale publique ſhould be bereued of his principall and moſt excellent partes, that the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nobles was aboliſhed, who would haue wrought the remedy and preſeruation of their wounded countrey. Therefore whereas ſage heades mighte not preuayle, where cutthrotes were counſellers, where fury and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ietted vp and doune vnpuniſhed, no miſchtefe coulde be imagined, no miſery deuiſed, wherewith that countrye was not ouerwhelmed and cleane ouerflowen.

But after the thirty <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes</hi> were for their ſharpe and tirannous gouernmente diſplaced, what was it that did ſcatter thoſe goods careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered, but the looſe life, and immoderate deſire of the frentike people? Whoſe fury and madnes was ſuche, that by no force or reſtreint of lawe, they coulde be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to haue any care or regarde of the common eſtate.

But it is the propertye of a liberal nature to yeelde all dutye and reuerence to them whiche doth excell other in knowledge and wiſedom, and to whom for a long tyme haue bene committed the care and cuſtodye of many people. And as the ſicke man doth no maner of ſeruice to the Phiſition, but willinglye foloweth his aduiſe and councell, becauſe he ſhal thereby be reſtored to health: and as the paſſenger obeyeth the maſter of the ſhippe, and the ſouldier his captaine: ſo it behoueth a multitude well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to yeeld them ſelues wholy into the handes of right noble and worthy perſonages. For the people through their dull wits and brutiſh nature cannot perceyue what is profitable eyther to themſelues, or for their countrye: on the other ſide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble mynd is not onely the worker of preſent profite, but alſo through great foreſight preuents imminent daunger. Furthermore the people hath no taſte or feelinge of honoure and renoume, and glorye, excepte they be by ſome ſtrayght law brydeled, and therefore are moſt couetous and giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al impyetie, and in the defence of their countrye are of no ſtoute &amp; hardye ſtomache. On the other ſyde the noble bloude is inflamed with the loue
<pb facs="tcp:13981:29"/> of renoume, and abhorreth daſtardlines as a moſt foule &amp; vgly vice, and in defence of a common profitt accompteth greate and daungerous enterpryces. Whiche by <hi>Homer</hi> (whoſe graue ſentences I do often recite and willinglye repete) is in manye places moſt playnly declared. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuche ſorte hee bryngeth in the king with ſundrye and diuers kyndes of oracions perſwadinge with the people, as thoughe therby his meaninge were to geue notice and intelligence to al worthy and noble perſonages by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> his prayſe, and worthines, that they in like maner ought to excite and ſtirre vp themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to ſtriue with him for fame, and glory. But vnto the rude and barbarous people yf they turne their backes in battayle, ſcourginge and killinge he denounceth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the ſtomach and courage of a luſty horſe doth moſt appeare, when hee yeeldeth to be guided by the will of a ſkillfull rider: And as we ſuppoſe our minde to bee beſt ſetled, when will to reaſon geueth the ſoueraignty: And as we thincke a houſhoulde to be well ordered, when it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the aduiſed diſpoſition of a wiſe and carefull houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder: So muſt we perſuade oure ſelues that the good eſtate of the people is then beſt ordered and eſtabliſhed, when they yeelde the free adminiſtration, and as it were the ſway of gouernmente to true Nobilitie.</p>

                  </gap>rience teacheth in thoſe who by ouermuch winebibbinges impayre their bodies health, and through ſuperfluitie, &amp; immoderatenes of belly cheere (as it were with a deadlye poiſon) procure their owne bane &amp; vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

But here I may ſomething doubte leaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this my diſcourſe may ſeeme to deſerue iuſt reprehenſion, becauſe it may at the firſt ſhew appere contrary to it ſelfe, wheras in our firſt entrie this aſſertion we mainteyned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man was to be accompted honourable, excepte hee did firſt deſcend from ſome noble line and family. Which if it be true, neither he which is borne of low degree and baſe parentage may by any meanes be honourable, neither he who deſcendeth from noble race, maye throughe his owne induſtry attaine renowne &amp; glory, but defende onely and maintayne carefully the Nobilitie gotten and purchaſed by the manhode and puiſſaunce of his aunceſtours. Theſe are the ſcruples and doubtes wherewith ſome maye bee ledde to argue mee of lightnes and inconſtancie.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13981:31"/>
               <p>But I in good ſooth am not he, which do beleue thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which are comonly called Gentlemen to be by naturall inclination apte to vertue and valiauntnes, whereas the pathwaye to proweſſe and vertue is open to all them, that do deſire thinges in their nature moſt excellent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to that ende tended the drifte of all my diſputation that the gentle and noble bloude is more then the other, by nature enclyned to dignitie &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable actes, the worthines whereof notwithſtandinge is ſurely grounded on vertue. For like as we attribute to the ſeede and carnell in the ground the cauſe and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tree: ſo we deeme the worthy and noble parent, through generation, to poure on his poſteritie ſome part of true Nobilitye, which then appeareth moſt liuely and floriſhing, when it is throughe good ſtudies and exerciſes brought to perfection. And where we would haue nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bee highlye eſteemed and honoured, becauſe it doth commonly excell in vertue: truly oure meaninge is, that Vertue which is worker and cauſer of ſo noble a qualitie, doth deſerue greate honour and eſtimation, which manye times wee ſee of noble men, let paſſe and forſaken, and of ſuch exceedinglye embraced, who are not commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs for their noble progenie. For no doubte it is not founde true in all, that the loftie and hautie minde which is ſeene in Nobility doth eftſones ſtirre them vppe to the loue of Vertue, neither would we haue eſtabliſhed that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but that we chiefely meant, that was founde moſte vſuall and generall. Notwithſtandinge Vertue from Nobility fraighte and beautifyed with vertue, differeth in this one pointe: that the prayſe and commendation of vertue belongeth to euery priuate &amp; ſinguler perſon, but noblenes is found more ample and large, and concerneth the honour and magnificence, of a whole ſtocke and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Therefore there maye happelye aryſe ſome late and new made gentleman endued with al kinde of vertue,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13981:31"/> who alſo through his worthines maye beare ſuch a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, that amonge all men hee may onely excell: yet notwithſtanding becauſe he is the firſt of that linage, may not be reckoned amonge noble men. But after that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſame family ſhall bee founde by his enſample to be inflamed with the loue of honour and glorie, then at the length that exceeding brightnes of true and perfecte No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes ſhal ſhine, and gliſter moſt gloriouſly. Therefore at the firſt hee is called a man endued with much gentlenes and curteſie, in no wyſe a noble man. That, that maye be the difference which the Grecians make betweene one that is a noble Gentleman, and a gentleman. For the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath relation to the worthines of the minde, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignifyeth the honour and dignitie of the race and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. Therfore as one we terme not a number, but the beginning of a number: ſo that firſt man we ſuppoſe and iudge worthy of chiefeſt honour, but yet no noble man, but rather an authour &amp; beginner of Nobilitie vnto his race and ofſpringe. Which name and title I my ſelfe know not, whither I may eſteeme farre and in many degrees to exceede and paſſe the other. Wherefore that is moſte cleare and manifeſte, that neither that is falſe which wee before put downe in wryting, and this alſo which we now take in hande to explicate and ſet forth, doth beare wyth it credite of vndoubted trothe. For that famous man who through the excellencie of his nature applyed himſelf firſt to the ſtudie of renowne and glorie, albeit commonly he be not termed noble, when notwithſtandinge hee hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained great fame and commendation, and hath left to his progenye the tokens and enſignes of vertue doth ſeeme to haue layd a notable foundation of Nobilitie, and with his vertuous actes to haue geuen a cleare lighte, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed true fame to his poſteritie. Now therfore it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we know by what meanes this ſo noble aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his ſtocke and kindred maye happen to him who is
<pb facs="tcp:13981:32"/> the firſt rayſer of his family to the highe &amp; princely place of honour &amp; Nobilitie. No doubt (that I may aunſwere briefly) by the ſame meanes whereby it is mainteyned and preſerued. But it is ſayd before, that Nobilitie is a kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red excelling in moſte rare and principall vertues. And thoſe according to the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the moſte lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Philoſopher, I accompt principall vertues which are occupied about the preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſocietie, through which alſo the ſafetie and ſecuritie of men is beſt kept and maintayned. But he which through priuate education is verye well trayned, and well inſtructed with preceptes of moralitie, may of good right be termed a good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man: but yet by other qualities he ſhall neuer procure great prayſe, and worthynes, except he applie them to the profite &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of the weale publique. For if we were borne onely for our owne ſakes and our owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, it were ſufficient that we ſought the aduauncement of our owne ſelues, and the preferment of thoſe which are contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within our owne family. But wheras we are moued by the inſtinct of Nature to helpe and profite other, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth beſte to haue diſcharged the dutie to him aſſigned, whoſe labour, ſtudye, and diligence hath bin imployed in matters of great waight and importaunce to the benefite and wealthe of his natiue country. Not for that truly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vertue of any priuate man ſhould bee deſpyſed and ſet at noughte: for by his good aduiſe and counſell if not all, yet ſome parte of the common wealth as his owne houſe &amp; family is well ruled and ordered. But wheras the vertue and wiſedome of this priuate and peculiar man is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wythin the bound and walles of his owne houſe, and extendeth it ſelfe no further, it ſeemeth good reaſon that the like honour and dignitie ſhould not be due to him, that is to ſome other, whoſe vertues are founde more vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and generall, and whoſe minde is more occupied with the carefull cauſe of his common wealth. For all men
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13981:32"/> would not generally accord to honour &amp; reuerence a few, except they did all manifeſtly perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, in caſes of great extremity by theyr greate paynes and trauaile to be aſſiſted. Therefore by knowledge of ciuill affayres and experience, there was made a certaine entrie to this kinde of gentilitie.</p>
               <p>THe chiefeſt and moſt principall part therefore of ciuil gouernement is iuſtice, which hath in it ſelfe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt apparaunt ſhew of vertue. The admiration whereof did in the beginning ſo greatly excite, &amp; ſtirre vp the minds of men, that they ſurrendered theyr goods and poſſeſſions, into the hands of ſome eſpeciall peeres, whom aboue all other they did honour and reuerence. For thus, when we treate of vertue, we vſe to diſpute. The tyme hath bin when men like barbarians haue lyued in woods, open fields, and deſolate places, without politique rule, &amp; ciuill gouernment: neyther embracinge religion nor by mutual loue and dutie ſhewing theyr humanity. Nothing was done in thoſe dayes, by due order of reaſon and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline but moſt matters were executed violently, whereas frantique and furious headines had the vpper hand. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then robberies were rife, murthers infinite, &amp; thoſe who in force and ſturdines paſſed other, would afflict and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iniuriouſly the weaker ſorte, and theyr whole lyfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed wyth innumerable miſchiefes, all they which had receyued the greater &amp; more greeuous iniuryes beſought the aſſiſtaunce of ſome one man in witte and pollicy excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding other, whom they perceyued to be vnto the reſt as it were a lanterne of Iuſtice, a myrroure of myldnes &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. This Patrone and ſupporter of right, when he had taken on him the charge of thoſe ſeely ſoules miſerably &amp; ſuppliantly yelding themſelues, &amp; declared vnto them the earneſt deſire he had to take away pillages &amp; robberies, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13981:33"/> to repreſſe violent murders, &amp; valiantly to reueng wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full oppreſſions, and to ſincke vnder like lawes both the mighty men &amp; ſimplet ſort: it came to paſſe that as many as tenderd their peculiar liberty, and ſoughte their owne ſecurity and quietnes, ſuppoſed him to be the defence and bulwarke of their ſafety &amp; proſperous eſtate, whoſe fame moſte flouriſhed for iuſtice and equity. From this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne therfore and head ſpring of iuſtice, iſſued out the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and auctority of Kinges, and the prerogatiue of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely gouernment: herehence proceeded the high degree of Nobility: herehence ſoueraingtie and the cauſe of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne &amp; glory was deriued: ſo that there is no one ſtocke more aunciente or more excellente, then the petegree of Kinges, which through their owne vertue and valiaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes abandoned al barbarous crueltie, reducing the people to good order and ciuilitie. Whoſe moſte deuine nature <hi>Heſiodus</hi> hauing in great admiration, in his Booke inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled the <hi>Genealogie of the Gods,</hi> fetcheth the liue and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of Princes, from <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe. Which opinion &amp; iudgemente of his, hath ben alſo receyued of many, in ſo much that they did moſt certainly ſurmiſe, that hee coulde not but deſcende from the Gods, which moſte of all other excelled in vertue. For it is reported that <hi>AEacus, Minos</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> were iudged to be the ſonnes of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> they were ſo much of all men for their iuſtice mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed: who as the Poets do fayne are ſayde to appointe lawes to the infernal ſpirites. So much did antiquity, yea euen amonge the deuils and helliſhe hounds beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeueritie of Lawes and force of iuſtice was expedient and neceſſary to reſtraine the vnbridled deſires of a diſordered multitude. <hi>Pittacus of Mytilene</hi> was through his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſkill and experience in iuſtice, aduaunced to the highe eſtate of a ruler.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi> being at Rome, for by vpright dealing and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of iuſtice, hee was thoughte and proclaymed by the

What needeth mee here to ſpeake of <hi>Lycurgus, Draco,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> that I omit in meane while to make any mention of <hi>Mercurie, Phoroneus,</hi> and diuers other, who haue beene longe time before, which haue wrought the ſafegarde and preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Citizens, by preſcribinge lawes and ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and haue thereby bene aduaunced to great honour, &amp; haue purchaſed to their poſterity perpetual fame and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Therefore to perſwade our ſelues that no one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue deſerueth the like preheminence, eyther is a like to be honoured, it is hereby to be ſéene, that each kinde of vertue beinge voyde of Iuſtice hath loſt his honour and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas Iuſtyce alone, ſecluded from other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, reteineth ſtill his eſpeciall grace and dignity. For profe whereof I mighte alledge a number of examples, but becauſe I meane to vſe breuity, I wil ſtande onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two. <hi>Aratus</hi> of <hi>Sicyon</hi> although him ſelfe held no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, yet through commendation of Iuſtice gotte ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume that by the iudgement of al men he might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the chiefeſt of all that euer raigned or ruled. He in his life time was euer preſt to wage battaile againſt tyrantes and wicked and diſordered Citizens, neither refuſed he in the defence of the lawes of his Cittye at any tyme to venture his life. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> who was alſo longe before the time of <hi>Aratus,</hi> was ſo highely eſteemed and honoured for hys preſeruation of Iuſtyce, that <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> though famous for hys valiaunt Actes, was neuer more highly reuerenced then he. Whereby it is euident &amp; plaine that there is no way more certaine then this, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our honour and glory: Or no waie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more readilye commendeth our poſterity to famous memorye.</p>
               <p>NExt and immediately after Iuſtice, a valiaunte cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which conſiſteth in daungerous attemptes, is
<pb facs="tcp:13981:34"/> lifted vp righte worthely to the higheſt ſteppe of honoure and dignity. For it is a matter of no ſmall importaunce ſo little to eſtéeme of life as to beſtowe it willingely and cherefully for the ſafegarde and preſeruation of all men, and to refuſe or feare for the wealth of our country no dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

On the other ſide there were for daſtardes euen by verye good ordinaunces moſt bitter tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and reproches moſte iuſtly appoincted. There was in olde time amonge the <hi>Macedonians</hi> a lawe ordeyned, that hee who had not in fight of battaile ouercame one, ſhoulde in the ſight of all men be truſt vp with a halter.

To none of the <hi>Amazones</hi> was graunted liberty to marry, excepte ſhe had in warre valiauntly vanquiſhed an enemy. <hi>Solon</hi> alſo made this decree, that their children, whoſe fathers had loſt their liues fightinge in the defence of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, ſhould be brought vp at the charge of the common treaſurye. Whiche was moſt wiſely vſed and practiſed in many other great and famous Citties. For moſt wiſely was it thought of <hi>Solon,</hi> the wiſeſt of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that the ſecurity and preſeruation of a common wealth did conſiſt in prefermente, and puniſhment. For

Which alſo in beſtowing the freedom of a Citty may be euidently knowen and conſidered. For yf he (as many ſuppoſe) bee taken and tearmed a Citizen which is bred and borne in a citye: no reaſon is, why into a Citye ſhould be receyued an alian and ſtraunger. Thence it proceeded that <hi>Gorgias Leontinus</hi> ſkoffing at the rulers of <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> becauſe they had receiued into their City many ſtraungers, was wont to ſaye that euen as plaſtereres of anye kynde of ſtuffe, would make morter, or any thinge of lyke ſorte: ſo there were ſome ſo cunning crafteſmen in <hi>Lariſſa</hi> whiche of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kynde of people were able to make Cityzens to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> But I for my parte do neyther lyke of <hi>Gorgias</hi> his oppynio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor of any other mens iudgemente which in lyke maner would ſtaye the cauſe of aduauncing ſubectes through the kinges and Princes moſt gratious fauour, and clemencie.

Then the which nothing

For this hath bene the purpoſed meaninge of Lawes and ordinaunces, and all well gouerned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths ought to haue in theim this practyſed and publiſhed, that men deſyrous to ſhew their valiant harts by daungerous attemptes, albeeit they are of their owne nature apt to defend the rights and lybertyes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, yet notwithſtanding, they ſhould ſtirre them therevnto, through an earneſt and ardente deſire of fame and glorye. For by this meanes the wealth of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey is moſt ſtrongely defended, and the indifferencie of Lawes &amp; ordinaunces beſt maynteyned. For what fowler ſhame, what greater diſhonour can there be imagined then to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue in the common wealthe appoynted vnto famous men, for their exceeding great and worthy exploytes, no reward at all? Eyther what reward may in any one poynte fully aunſweere and ſatiſfy a noble mynde, then to be receyued triumphantly of the people? Furthermore what is in it ſelfe more princely and more glorious, then to geue vnto vertue his due deſert, and to yeeld to worthines, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble titles, &amp; to true nobilite the principallity? that iuſtice might not onely by this meanes be happely kepte and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, but alſo many thereby moughte be allured to bend themſelues to the ſtudy of vereue. For it is not in the po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer of the Prince (that now I may anſwere that whiche mighte be obiected afore) to bringe to paſſe that a bile and abiecte mynde ſhoulde bee noble and honorable, whiche commeth not by grace and fauoure, but proceadinge from nature, is fully made and perfected by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exerciſes of moſte worthy and lawdable ſciences. And yet a Prince maye adourne and ſette foorth excedingly a noble &amp; inuincible mynde withe worthye and honourable titles.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13981:37"/> eſtate. To approue this my opinion I coulde vſe the authority of moſt excellente men, and moſte ſkilfull in the gouernment of a common wealth, but I will alledge one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Plato,</hi> in whom, in his thirde boke entreating of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth <hi>Socrates</hi> by a certayne fable, wherein manye armed men were feined, to aryſe out of the earth, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Cityzens to mutuall loue and concord. And then immediatly proceedeth in his talke in this maner. Geue eare (quoth he) to the reſt of the fable. All ye that liue in one Citty are brothers, beinge ſtreightly linked, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together. But yet when God created you, he gaue not to euery one, the ſame property, and vertue. For they that were moſt meete to rule, were tempered with gould: Againe thoſe who in the defence of their countrye woulde valiauntly aſſiſt the Péeres of the realme, hee mingled with ſiluer: And vppon ſutch as applied theym ſelues to tillage and other baſe occupations, hee beſtowed braſſe, &amp; Iron.

For truly he that was firſt rayſer of your royaltie, and the chiefeſt cauſe that you are in this eſtate and countenaunce, was an vpſtarte and newe made gentleman. Therefore whereas you in this maner taunt and reuile them which are moſt like to your predeceſſours, and do diſdainfully rippe vppe thoſe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches agaynſte them, which maye bee turned backe vppon your owne frendes, you do not onely bring that to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throughe your ſhamefull behauiour you ſtaine and demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe the prayſe of your aunceſtours, but alſo vngrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt vnkindly you demeane your ſelfe, whilſte that with ſcorneful ſpeaches you debaſe and extenuate the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy renowne of them, of whom you firſt receyued this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew of honour and dignitie.

               <p>AFter that I haue reproued their brainſicke dealinge, who vtter bitter &amp; contumelious taunts againſt ſuch, as are of late through their wyſedome &amp; vertue preferred to the eſtate of gentlemen, they themſelues notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding being defiled wyth all kinde of wickednes, now it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be cald in queſtion, whether of them are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, or more commended of all men. They, who haue through their vertue &amp; honeſtie purchaſed to themſelues greate renowne, prayſe, and commendation, being ſtirred therunto by no example of their aunceſtours: or they, who do earneſtly folow &amp; embrace thoſe vertues, which chiefly ſhined, &amp; were highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in their forefathers. For it is a doubtful and perplexed queſtion, and probable truly on either ſide, in ſo much that either of them maye be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by argument. For the new made gentleman may defend his cauſe arguing in this maner. I haue applyed my minde to the loue of vertue, I haue bin inflamed wyth the deſire of renowne, not ſtirred therunto through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of my forefathers, or prouoked by the fame &amp; glory of any aunceſtour. Againe, I haue atchiued to the place of dignitie, not by the helpe and furtherance of any other, but by mine owne induſtry. I haue aduaunced to honour my name &amp; bloud, which was before obſcure and litle rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned of, and I haue giuen an example and lighte to my poſteritie. But you ſir, who are deſcended of an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable line, and came of a righte gentlemans houſe, haue had great furtherau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> attayni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of renowne &amp; glory.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13981:42"/> thy education and trayninge vp gentlemanlike, laſt of all the expectation of men, which ioyned together forced the as it were by neceſſity to embrace vertue. Neither is the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation ſo great which you haue gotten through the imitation and folowing the actes of your aunceſtours, as the reproch and rebuke woulde haue bin, if you had not manfully endeuoured to be like vnto them in glorye &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, which were of your owne houſe and kinred. Therefore you haue done nothinge with praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, whereas you were therunto brought and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by neceſſity. On the other ſide, I had by no meanes ſtayned my bloud, if I had remayned baſe and obſcure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially whereas I wanted all thoſe helpes and ordinary meanes, wherewith you were greatly furthered to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning whatſoeuer you toke in hande. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beinge vrged with no neceſſitie, but allured wyth ſincere loue of vertue, diſpoſed my minde to do thinges of great importance, ſoundinge to my greate credite and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that I perfourmed with no ſmall praiſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thou art therefore to be commended onely for thine owne vertue, I am not onely through mine owne induſtry to be honoured, but alſo to be preferred for the puiſſaunce and magnanimitie wherein my forefathers excelled. But concerninge domeſticall glorie, in that you ſay gentlemen are neceſſarilye ſtirred &amp; forced to the attayning of vertue, nay truly wee ſee very many conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the honour attayned by their parents, and there to reſt ſeeking no further, becauſe they accompt it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente to enioye prayſe and commendation gotten by other mens trauaile.

To conclude, ſome finde in me the lacke of experience, other require a finer head, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde wiſhe more ripenes of vnderſtanding. Whom I will briefly ſhape an aunſwere, before I enter into the diſcuſſing of any queſtion. Truly for my owne parte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe I was neuer ſo farre in loue with my ſelfe, or ſo pricked with the deſire of prayſe, that I haue challenged anye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, for that I haue by witte compaſſed, or throughe the excellency of any learninge atchieued: yet I thought it the part and propertie of a noble natured yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, earneſtly bent to the ſtudy of moſte worthy knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not to reſt contented with thinges of meane accompt, but deſirouſly to purſue &amp; hunt after the higheſt matters, and thoſe which are entangled with greateſte difficultie.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13981:44"/> For no man oughte to thinke it impoſſible to be the beſte learned, and to attaine the ſecond place, to them onely it is graunted, which with a iolly ſtomacke, and loftie mind, purpoſe to be peereleſſe. For this leſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we learne by an old Prouerbe. The ſhorte ſhooter neuer hitteth the marcke. For if men mighte enterprice no kinde of ſtudye, but that which they deemed might with ſmal labour be obteyned, I thincke no man at any time ſhould haue bin but meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, much leſſe endued with the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For, neither do I thinck <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf, when firſt he ſet his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to paper, to haue thought his labour ſhould haue had ſuch happie ſucceſſe, as afterwarde hee gotte through great practiſe, &amp; daily exerciſe. Neither <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> in his firſte entrie, had anye ſuch confidence in his wit and learning, that he thought, hee ſhould afterwards excell <hi>Pericles.</hi> Neither <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he firſt applied his minde to the ſtudie of Rhetoricke was of this opinion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he thoughte he ſhould be a father of eloquence, a lighte of learning, and ſuch a one which for the grace and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gift of Oratorie, might triumph as one that had won the victorie. But when they were ſtirred vp by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte of an excellente nature and noble minde, that they ſhould attempt ſtudies more great, then were at that time agreeable to their reach and capacitie, they gotte by this meane to be exquiſitely learned, and attayned thereby the higheſt and principall pointe of knowledge. And what may bee ſayde of thoſe to whom is graunted but a meane meaſure of learning? Could they (I pray you) haue retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that place, except they had hardily preſumed to folow and trace the ſteps of them, which in learning were of dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt iudgement? Otherwyſe truly it would not haue bin ſo wel with vs, that we could attaine ſo eaſely knowledge of vs deſiered, or ſo happely diſcharge things of vs atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherfore it ſtandeth greatly vpon all ſuch which are as it were through loue, enamoured with the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of
<pb facs="tcp:13981:45"/> any one ſcience, not onelye to endeuour earneſtlye for that which is chiefely deſired, but alſo to centinue their ſtudie further, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may with leſſe paine, &amp; labour be broughte to the attayning their intended purpoſe. Now therfore whereas it is diligently diſcuſſed and tryed out, that there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſteemed or reckoned of, except he doth endeuour with all ſtudie to attaine thinges in their nature moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente and commendable, they are not to be arouſed of boldnes, which beſtow their labour in the ſearch of highe cauſes, naye rather their lithernes, and vnmanlye cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is greatly to bee reproued, who dare not venture to do the like. Neither their talke withdraweth me from wryting, who peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture do looke for any other kinde of eloquence, then that, which the nature of the argumente wil require, and the ſlendernes of my knowledge wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me in this diſpute to follow. For if no matter ſhould be diſcuſſed &amp; entreated of, but that which mighte be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly amplifyed, plentifully enlarged, and eloquently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, there ſhould haue bin no monument exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at all, of any ſuch thinges (which I ſay not) could be by any tongue vttered, no not by reaſon compryſed, or by the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, but in part conceiued. For there is no man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued wyth that excellencie of witte, and iudgement, wyth that wonderfull gifte of eloquence, that can diſpute wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely or exactly ſpeake of pietie, true religion, of the holy, hidden, and ſecrete miſteries of Chriſtianity, laſtlye of the vnſpeakeable Maieſtie, and omnipotencie of God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of which wee ſhall for the moſt parte entreate. And truly there is no cauſe or reaſon, that thoſe ſhould deſerue the name of modeſt and diſcreete men, which are through the greatnes of any argumente at the firſt diſcouraged, &amp; therefore throughe ſuch conceite fayntinge, take rather in hand other matters, then ſuch, which ſhould concerne the worthines and honour of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> relligion: there is not onely reaſon why they ſhoulde not purchaſe prayſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13981:45"/> but alſo whye they ſhoulde iuſtly incurre the blame of impiety. And therfore al learned men who haue earneſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly embraced true godlines and integrity of life, hath fully accorded in this opinion, that they haue thoughte it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable offence, to beſtowe their ſtudy vppon any other thinge then that, which ſhould ſet forth the glory and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of true religyon, when notwithſtandinge they knewe for a certenty, that no mans eloquence, were it neuer ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedinge wonderfull, coulde effectuouſly declare ſo highe knowledge, moſt ample matter importinge. They haue therfore wrot many bookes, wherof ſome are finely &amp; curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlye penned, other in rude and barbarous Phraſe, yet greately to be had in eſtimation, for the ſubſtance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde matter, and moſt feruent zeale of piety and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Furthermore many of thoſe writers haue vtterly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed all manner of picked eloquence, and figures of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique,</hi> as triflinge and childiſhe toies, and nothinge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine or agreable with the worthines and dignity of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion. Wherefore we muſt the rather be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted if we do not perfit any thing as we would, either may not attaine that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue longe deſired: Whereas the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of other excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wel learned, may in this caſe ſatiſfy vs, &amp; alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excéeding deapnes of knowledge may be vnto vs no ſmal occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of let &amp; impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Neither is it a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny whit impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to forewarn you, that ſuch matter hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peneth in handlinge holy write, in dyſcuſſing whereof the purenes of the latine ſpeach is not obſerued: eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge ſuch, which binde them ſelues to no ſtreight lawe, and had rather open the meaninge of any harde &amp; obſcure matter playnly although not ſo ſmoothly, as darckely &amp; elegantly. Neyther doubte I at all, if any thinge be ſet downe of vs in theſe bookes vnproperly or groſely, which notwithſtandinge ſhall be avouched out of holy ſcripture, that I ſhall thereby deſerue reprehenſion, if men not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate may iudge therein. But I ſhewe herein my
<pb facs="tcp:13981:46"/> imperfection (<hi>Lewis</hi> moſt renoumed Prince) in that I dooe at all feare the cenſure of other, in theſe thinges which on your maieſty I beſtowe alone. For I do aſſure my ſelfe, that your highnes will take in good parte theſe my doinges (ſuch as they are) more for the greate good will, which eſpecially moued me to write, then for any ſkil therein conteined. And that I do ſo mutch preſume, the excellency of your good nature, the noblenes of your bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull hart always to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, doth geue me no ſmall occaſion. For when I wrote vnto you my booke entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of Nobility eſtabliſhed by ciuill pollicie, which was of me compiled nothinge learnedly, wherein no elegancy, or fine poinct of ſkill was ſhewed, I founde that my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and earneſt deſier was vnto your grace acceptable, not onely by the plentifull rewardes and great giftes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly on me beſtowed, but alſo by that whiche you ſpake very honourably ſoundinge to my great prayſe &amp; commendation, which I in deede haue more, then of any other, by a great deale accompted of. For I aſſure you, thoughe leaſt of any thinge I deſire praiſe, yet I was therewith moued with exceedinge ioye, wheras I holde this as an infallible truth, that the good opinion of a prince ſo great and vertuous, doth ſurmounte al titles of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which might redounde to mans glory. I haue nowe therefore compiled a newe worke, more ample, &amp; of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force, then that which was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other two bookes diſpu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted: principally moued thereunto through an ardente and earneſt zeale, which I beare vnto godlines, then eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to declare my diligence, and dutifull harte to youre royall maieſty. And albeit they haue one name, and beare the like inſcription, yet the argument which we at this preſent do handle, is farre differinge from that, whiche was vttered, in that our breife inſtruction. For we diſputed there, howe ſome linages through a good diſpoſition of nature, embraceth vertue, which if it happely grewe, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13981:46"/> by continuall and daily practiſe come to perfection, it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth that excellencie of nature, which we call noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of birth. In which diſcourſe truely, when firſt after the manner and order of <hi>Logicians,</hi> we defininge nobility, and deuidinge the ſame into certaine partes, endeuoured to expreſſe and declare the force and nature thereof, then we ſpake of the firſte beginninge and antiquitye thereof, not omittinge whatſoeuer is in any olde monument repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſuch, who hath ſuſteined any laboure or perill, for the loue and true honour of vertue. Laſtly whereas the eſtate of Nobility, (as of all other thinges incidente and apperteyninge to the eſtate of man, is variable and much ſubiect to alteration, we haue there taught, by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes honour is obteined, and contrarywiſe, by what vices it is blemiſhed and bereued of his accuſtomed lighte and beautye. And the dryfte of all our diſputation and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge was this, to make it knowen vnto all men that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as vpon a chiefe Pyllour reſteth on vertue, and that the Pillour of vertue beinge ſhaken and ouerthrowen, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitye it ſelfe falleth to the grounde. But beecauſe all that vertue whereof then eſpeciallye we did intreate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it haue at the firſt a great and glorious ſhewe, yet doth it not reach vnto that abſolute perfection of vertue that wee woulde gladlye attaine, but wholye conſiſteth in the practiſe of Policie, rather by the opinion of men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, then ſet forth through the true, cleare, and diuine light of perfect holines, I haue thought good, the grounde and beginninge thereof more deepely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by diligent ſtudye to ſearch and trace out, what is the full force, and nature of true and perfect vertue: that, that beinge conſidered, and manifeſtly knowen, we might euidently beholde the figure and image of that noblenes, whoſe ſubſtaunce is pure, whoſe qualities perfite, whoſe figure moſt delicate and excéedinge beautifull. For ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that noblenes of birth procéedeth from vertue, it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth
<pb facs="tcp:13981:47"/> with good reaſon, that we ſhould take thoſe to be the worthieſt and nobleſt houſes, which hath ſpronge of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, &amp; inuiolate godlines, which is not through vaine pompe, and glorious oſtentation ratified, but through ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritye of good life, and vpholdinge iuſtice, generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and confirmed. In this worke therefore diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinge that vertue which conſiſteth in opinion, from that which is true and perfect, wee purpoſe verily to deſcribe the excellent qualities of that nobility, which by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and ordinaunce of Almighty God is geuen to them, that profeſſe Chriſtianity. But foraſmuch as vertue in his right nature may not be knowen, except it be fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vppon, what is that ſoueraigne good and chiefe feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, whereunto duringe our liues we direct all our deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and dooinges (foraſmutch as vertue is nothinge els but a redie way guidinge vs to the chiefeſt and perfecteſt ende of all thoſe thinges, which poſſibly we can in mans life deſire:) therefore whereas the laſt ende muſt bée knowen, before we may vnderſtande what vertue is: firſt of all we w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll endeuour to declare, what is that laſt ende purpoſed to man, vnto the which we are by nature ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and from whence all honour and dignity hath flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and wherein chiefly is put the ſtate of mans felicity. For we cannot ſo mutch as by imagination ſeclude nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from vertue, and excepte vertue worcke to ſome good end and purpoſe it ought not to be called properly by that name: It remaineth therefore that without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mans felicity no kinde of nobility can in any wiſe be founde or perceiued. Furthermore whereas it is the property of a Noble minde and excellent nature to clime higher, and to aduaunce his minde to the beholdinge of thinges in Heauen, and not regarde the vayne ſhéewe, of tranſitory pleaſures: it is apparant that he is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; worthieſt of honour, which deſireth ſome one thing moſt principall and excellent. Therefore I am determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13981:47"/> in this firſt booke to declare what felicity, is alſo to tret of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtate &amp; dignity of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, laſtly of his decay, fall &amp; great miſery: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by this mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s I may haue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to declare vnto what dignity &amp; worthines hee is reſtored, &amp; what honour through <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> he hath attained. But now I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to beſech you (moſt renoumed Prince) that you wil te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der theſe my doings with like gentlenes and clemencie as you haue alwaye moſt gratiouſly fauoured ſuch which haue born towards you a faithful &amp; loial hart. For I ſhall think my labour wel &amp; ſufficiently rewarded, if I may vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand that this my good will was vnto you acceptable offered in dilatyng this kynde of argument.</p>
               <p>VVHerfore that wee maye repete this matter from the beginninge, it is manifeſt that all menne hathe fyxed before their eies ſome certayne marke or end, vnto which they direct their doinges, &amp; whatſoeuer is inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in this lyfe. And al men with one voyce call this laſte end a life bleſſed, floriſhinge and happye, deuoyde of all kynde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, and abounding with all kynde of felicity. But wher in this felicitye conſiſteth, there hath bene alwaies among mortall men a verye greate and a continuall diſſention, in ſo muche the moſt part of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not accorded in one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynion. For ſuche as euery mans Phantaſie is, ſuche an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pynyon touchinge the chiefeſt and ſoueraigne good dothe he embrace. For at the beginninge they that gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer wholy to carnall and ſenſuall delightes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde withe their eyes beholde the moſte excellente parte of theymſelues: they eyther in riches, or luſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuppoſed that laſt deſired ende of man to be repoſed. For ſome of them did verely think that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of all external commodities felicitye was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, and thoſe commodityes which (onelye their vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding was able to reach vnto) by ſtore of welth they ſaw procured. Some other when they were not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
<pb facs="tcp:13981:48"/> any greater delight, then that which with a ſweete pleaſure moueth the ſences, ſuppoſed felicitie to be replete with all kynde of ioye and pleaſure, and therfore did with all earneſt endeuoure ſeke to embrace the pleaſure of the body. But they which were afflicted with any greuous calamity, eyther tormented and ſhaken with an incurable maladie of the body or weer vehementlye oppreſſed wyth aduerſe fortune, ſuche placed the whole perfection of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lyfe and chiefe happines in the ſound and perfect health of the bodye, and in ſuche meanes as coulde ridde and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pache them from all ſuch diſtreſſe and miſery. But the intollerable errour, and exceedinge folly of ſuche ſemeth rather with banninges and curſes, then with woordes and argumentes to be refelled, as a thing more woorthy of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation then confutation. For who ſeeth not their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious madnes, who, ſith we conſiſt of body and ſoule one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of one part of themſelus, and that truely which is in nature farre inferior to the other, &amp; that which is common to vs with brute and ſauage beaſtes: But the other parte they do neglecte which is euerlaſtinge, and hath in it imprinted the figure and true Charecter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature. Agayne other there are (that wee leaue this abiecte and vile kynde of people) who beeyng endued wyth more vnderſtandinge, and conceiuinge muche more of the woorkes of nature dooe couet wyth all care and induſtry to atchiue to the titles of honour and dygnyty, for there is by nature ingendred in vs a certayne ſparcle of excellencie and noble courage kindling in vs a deſire of honoure and principality, whiche in thoſe men that are of a princely mynde doth moſt euidently appeare and ſhew it ſelfe. And yet theſe in this one poynt are muche deceiued and greatly miſſe the mark, for they frame theyr life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the opinion of the vnlearned people, and repoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe poynt of true praiſe and commendation on the vain brute and eſtimation, of the fooliſh and raſcall multitude.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13981:48"/> Laſtly they are greatly to be reproued for that they deſire preheminence and auctority, as the laſt reward of al their lyfe.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas ſome wayte for a place of honour to the ende they may liue licenciouſly, ether that they might in deede through preheminence ſhew the true paterne of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they of al other are moſt ignorante whiche ſuppoſe in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their deſires acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed that to bee conteined, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of vs onely is, and ought to be deſired. For as much the laſt deſired ende hath no further relation, but eache thinge for that endes ſake is deſired and laboured for. Wherefore all kynde of pleaſure, perfett health, and ſuch lyke are to be numbred amonge the loweſt and baſeſte ſorte of goode thinges, yf they deſerue ſuche name or tytle at all. For we may moderately ſometymes deſire auctority, more mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued therevnto through reaſon then prouoked by ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that we may further the weale and profite of other, not that we ſhoulde thinke them the rewarde of all oure well liuinge. But I leaue to ſpeake any more of the Phantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall opynions of the people, that I may march on apace towardes theym whiche haue profeſſed theymſelues guydes and inſtructoures of other in matters tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge honeſtye, and the good conuerſation of lyfe. Yet I promiſe not to cite all, for it weere an endles labour to recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te ſo many opinions as are in the mounments &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Philoſophers deliuered vnto vs. But I wil paſſe ouer them with ſilence, whoſe iudgement hath nothinge differed from the opinion of the common people. For tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whereas they had defiled theymſelues wyth all kynde of abomination they hauinge theyr ſighte duſked with a dark cloud of filthines and ſhame were able to ſee nothing but that whiche apperteined to the luſt and pleaſure of the bodie, or to outwarde gaine &amp; external commodity. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore I wil lett to ſpeak of <hi>Cyrenaickes,</hi> an obſcure ſect of philoſophers <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Rhodes, Ariſtippus,</hi> and the <hi>Epicure</hi> in whoſe bokes are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined both their opinions.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13981:49"/> For it is vnmeete that they ſhoulde by any meanes be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted amonge them that are famous and renowmed for their witte and learning.</p>
               <p>THerefore that we may vnderſtand what the opinion of the moſt renowmed Philoſophers hath bin, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parante that the <hi>Academickes</hi> and <hi>Peripatetickes</hi> haue ſayde and affirmed that the nature of good thinges are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into three kinds. In the firſt parte they accompte thoſe thinges which pooliſhe &amp; adourne the minde: which againe is ſorted into two partes. For one ſort furniſheth the minde &amp; prepareth it to the ſearche and knowledge of many thinges: the other inſtruct and enforme the will of man to all kinde of vertues, whereunto we are ledde and induced by wyſedomes preſcription and moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the ſeconde place they accompte healthe and whatſoeuer maye keepe and preſerue the bodye in his good eſtate and perfection. Laſtly all thoſe thinges that happen vnto vs by fortune and caſual aduenture, they place in the laſt and loweſt degree. But when all theſe good thinges are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vppon ſome one man, they thinck then, that bleſſed life is complete and perfect. But ſo that vertue be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the ſame continually exerciſed, and put in vre: but the good gifts either of the body or of fortune, they ſhould to that ende retaine, to make them ſeruauntes and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids of vertue, which ſhoulde waite vppon her at euery becke, without the neceſſary helpes wherof vertue (for all that) could not commodiouſly, and well diſcharge her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the beſte learned, &amp; Prince of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers doth after this maner declare by definition what felicitie is. It is (ſayth he) an action of the minde, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and agreeing to the preſcript rule, of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue, exerciſed all the whole terme and ſpace of the life of man. And this opinion is likewiſe that, that great and excellente vertue can in no wyſe ſhine and ſhew forth
<pb facs="tcp:13981:50"/> his force, if the body be either afflicted wyth any greeuous calamitie, or the minde diſquieted throughe the iniurie and malice of frowarde Fortune. Neither is he by any meanes ſo to bee perſwaded, that hee maye ſuppoſe that life worthely termed a happie life, which in proceſſe of time maye driue a man to wofull waylinge, and fall into miſerable eſtate and extreme calamitie. He hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined that whatſoeuer wee ſhall do and take in hande in this life, ſhalbe to this purpoſe that firſt the moſte excellente vertues of the minde ſhoulde be ſoughte for, and embraced, then hee that deſireth to obtaine feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie ſhoulde bee ſo well prouided of worldlye ſubſtaunce, that both hee maye in this life maintayne his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce wyth credite, and that the continuall practiſe of vertue do not ceaſe by the meanes of pouertie and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable penurie. And that the power and abilitie, which the qualities of the body and fortune do yelde, ſhould to no other thinge haue more eſpeciall relation, then to the maintenaunce of true worſhippe and honeſtie. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily theſe thinges, becauſe they ſeeme to bee ſo ſayd, that they may moſte fitly bee applyed to the life of man: they are almoſte ſo generally by euery mans opinion allowed, that no mans iudgemente at this day is more vniuerſally receyued. For hee giueth to vertue the prorogatiue, by the ſhyninge and cleare brightnes whereof, all men well trayned and brought vppe, are chiefly guided. But when hee ſayth that other good thinges both belonginge to the body, and depending on fortune are not to be deſpiſed, then hee ſeemeth to be one that fawneth on the people, and pleaſeth their humour and fonde delighte. In which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion notwithſtanding how many groſſe errours be, hee may eaſely perceiue which wyth dilligent and deepe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will ponder this matter. By the exerciſe (ſayth hee) of the moſt excellente vertue, bleſſed life is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13981:50"/> accompliſhed. If the caſe ſtande thus, then let vs vnderſtande what maner a thing that vertue is, the cauſe efficient of ſo wonderfull and great bleſſedn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, eyther by what meanes it is obtayned, or how wee maye diſtinguiſh honeſtie which is perfecte and abſolute, from the falſe and pretended colour of honeſtie. For I coulde neuer yet geſſe how vertue could be vnderſtoode, excepte the nature of the laſt and ſoueraygne good be firſt plainly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly knowen. For vertue is nothinge els but a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of reaſon, leadinge vs to the attayninge the laſt deſired ende of bleſſednes and felicitie. And then reaſon (ſaye they) is moſt perfecte, when like as one that leueleth his ſhafte or darte at ſome marke: ſo reaſon beholdeth ſome purpoſed ende, as it were a marcke, whither it directeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery action. Therefore the excellencie of true vertue by no meanes can bee perceyued, excepte the ende vnto the which it ſhoulde readely bringe vs, bee perfectly kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. The which thing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe hath taught: foraſmuch as before he would any thinge at all entreate of vertue, hee tooke in hande to expreſſe and declare what felicitie was, that that being knowen, the nature power, and efficacie of true vertue mighte eftſones appeare, the which notwythſtandinge he coulde in no wyſe performe. For I woulde willingly learne of him, what manner a thing that felicity is, for the attayning wherof, I ſhould refuſe no laboure and trauayle.</p>
               <p>Here hee reckoneth the vertues of the minde, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the bodye, the goods of Fortune, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge obtayned, felicity is attayned. And in the firſte place hee repoſeth the duties that proceede from Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Nowe truly manifeſte it is that this is a ſtraunge and prepoſterous order that the laſte deſired ende ſhould be knowen by Vertue, not Vertue by the laſte deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ende.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13981:51"/>
               <p>But let vs graunt him that, that at length wee moughte perfectly ſee into the nature of Vertue. Vertue (ſayth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>) is a conſtante affection of the minde, obtayned by free election, conſiſtinge in a certaine mediocritie, and the ſame being directed by the righte rule of reaſon. But I pray you proceede a litle further in this matter, for as yet I perceiue not what vertue is. What meane you then by the righte rule of reaſon, which is to vs by you deliuered in the definition of vertue. That is it (ſayth he) in another place, which beinge obſcured by no kinde of darcknes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficultie ſeeth that laſte ende vnto the which all the doinges and actions of our life ought to bee referred. Now thou doeſt turne mee ouer againe to the ſearchinge out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt deſired end, which that I might plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſearching out of the ſame, thou didſt put mee ouer to the conſideration of vertue. I pray you what other thinge is it to tourne round in a circle, if this be not? Firſt you ſay that vertue bringeth vs to felicitie. Then againe you ſo deſcribe felicitie, that except firſt wee perfectly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of vertue, what felicity is, we cannot ſo muche as by coniecture imagine. This therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mee to ſtand in a muſe: for neyther do I vnderſtande what vertue is, neither whither it tendeth. But to leaue theſe crabbed and difficult matters, it ſhalbe very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know whether that felicitie which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would frame, be ſuch a thing as we might happely at any time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. For if it bee of that nature that it cannot bee obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither that any maye poſſibly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe, becauſe of the inconſtancie and frailtie of mans eſtate and condition, what ſhall that deſcription of happie life profite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſocietie of man? Moreouer whereas all thinges in the whole vniuerſall worlde do commonly at the length come to their ende and perfection, no doubte it were an errour intollerable to thincke, that onely man, for whoſe ſake all thinges which wee ſee wyth oure eyes were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13981:51"/> ſhould neuer come to his prefixed felicitie, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> muſt confeſſe, being thereunto dryuen by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. For whereas his opinion is that felicitie is to be obtayned in this life, and withall giueth ſuch power and preheminence to Fortune, that with a boyſterous blaſte of her diſpleaſure, our happie eſtate may be ſhaken in ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and vtterlye ouerwhelmed, hee ſeemeth thereby to make men euer in a wretched and miſerable caſe. For who is hee to whom any priuiledge or immunitie is grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thoſe miſchieues, wherewith wee ſee this life oppreſſed and continually afflicted? Is there (ſaye I) any man ſo free and exempted from miſerie, but that ſometimes, will hee, or nill hee, hee taſteth of the cuppe of calamitie, or at the leaſt maye not dreade ſuch diſcomfitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res wyth the which the happy life (if it may bee ſo called) maye bee both obſcured and vtterly loſte? For all men which liue on the face of the earth toke life chiefly to this ende and purpoſe, that they ſhould conſume theyr dayes in teares and mourninge, and ſpende the greateſte part of their life lamentably, languiſhinge in greate woe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerye. Neyther in anye age or memorye of man coulde there euer ſo much as one man be founde, vnto whom by many degrees there did not more euill, then good betide. <hi>Solon</hi> for his wyſedome the moſte renowmed Grecian, beinge demaunded of <hi>Craeſus</hi> Kinge of <hi>Lydia,</hi> whom hee iudged to bee of all other moſte happie, aunſweared, one <hi>Tellus</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> which had begotten in a Countrye aboundinge wyth all commodities, children excelling in goodlines of perſonage, and ſtrength of bodie: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defendinge his Country manfullye, ended his life wyth greate glory. Alſo hee added to <hi>Tellus, Cleobis,</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi> borne in the Cittie of <hi>Argos,</hi> who when they had marueylouſly ſhewed their good nature and dutifull obedience to their mother departed this life. For theyr

                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13981:52"/> of theyr frendes wyth dauncing and ſinginge. For they thought it moſt conuenient to weepe and mourne at their natiuitie, being the beginninge of all miſery: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwyſe to death as to the ende of all wretchednes, they thoughte reioyſinge was moſte agreeable. But what neede I to this effecte and purpoſe diſcourſe any more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples? For not onely by the teſtimonies of aunciente wryters, but alſo by infinite examples wythin the time of our owne remembraunce it maye be clearely perceyued, that no man hath euer liued that hath not bin verye often times diſtreſſed wyth cares, vexations, daungers, and an infinite ſorte of diſeaſes and calamities. Yet there are ſome recorded by learned wryters, not many, which haue bin of the common people thoughte happie: Such as <hi>Metellus</hi> of <hi>Macedonia, Caeſar Octauius, Lucius Silla</hi> were: and one or two more, which mighte bee reckoned wyth theſe. But they that write of the miſfortunes which diuerſlye happened vnto them, they that make reporte of their aduerſe and crooked fortunes wherewythall they were oftentimes toſſed from poſte to piller, giue vs moſte certayne and euidente notice of the intollerable burden of mannes miſerye. For they that in their worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres had verye good and proſperous ſucceſſe, coulde not eſcape thoſe hard brunts and ineuitable calamities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth mans life is compaſſed on euery ſyde, what maye wee thincke of all the reſidew, which by all mennes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion were vnhappy and myſerable. But admitte Fortune were vnto any man ſo fauourable, and bountiful, that ſhee woulde heape vppon him all commodities that poſſibly hee could in his life requyre: commonly we ſhall ſee him haue ſome Tragicall ende, beinge eyther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne as a Caytife, or truſſed vppe like a Trayter. The which thinge happened to <hi>Polycrates</hi> of the Ile of <hi>Samos,</hi> who when hee had lyued in greate proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13981:52"/> during the ſpace and terme of all his life, was at len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth taken of his enemye, bereued of his life, and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all his goods. What ſhoulde I here ſpeake of the death of <hi>Cyrus?</hi> What ſhould I make mention of the ruthfull ende of <hi>Cambyſes?</hi> What ſhould I call to memory the heauy, lamentable, and dolefull death of <hi>Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peie</hi> the great? To what ende ſhould I recite a number of other, who haue yéelded ſufficient matter of moſt pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamentations in tragedies and other ſolempne ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies? Whereas daily the courſe of common life geueth vs to vnderſtande that there is in the whole earth no kind of liuinge creature more ſubiect to al kind of miſeries, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man. If therefore accordinge to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion theſe good thinges eyther of the body, or fortune, to the full furniture of a bleſſed life are required: And the euelles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to them, make our life wretched and miſerable, no man (I aſſure you) can be accoumpted happy. For their is no man but is ſometimes greatly diſquieted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> horrible miſchiues, or at leaſt (which is to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame effect) dreadeth not day &amp; night al miſadue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures that may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to man, much like vnto thoſe, which are ſayd to bée in helliſhe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <l>do hange, and ſeemeth falling aie to cruſh their pates with all.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Therefore that man of ſo great iudgement hath beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed all his diligence in vaine, by ſettinge forth vnto vs ſuch a felicity, which al men woulde wiſhe for willingely, but no man can attayne poſſibly. If ſo be that he, that excelled all other in wit, in induſtry, in iudgement coulde not redely ſee what was to be deſired in this life: What may wee thincke of the reſt, whoſe iudgement was farre vnlyke, whoſe conninge and knowledge in the ſearchinge
<pb facs="tcp:13981:53"/> out of high and ſubtile qeſtions was farre differinge, ſuch as the <hi>Stoikes</hi> were.</p>
               <p>ANd the chiefe of this <hi>Stoike</hi> ſecte was <hi>Zeno,</hi> a man bothe ſage and continente, who thoughte him ſelfe through vertue ſufficiently able both to withſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge griefes of ſorowe, &amp; to eſcape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> threatninge thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boltes of frowarde fortune, becauſe he was very well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with onely vertue, for the body he ſet at naught, and meaſured felicity onely by the qualities of the mind. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge he taught ſuch kinde of doctrine, which no wiſe man will beléeue, excepte he be wedded vnto his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (for often times many doe ſtande in argument more that they mought ſeeme conſtante, then beinge thereunto induced by reaſon and vnderſtandinge) I ſaye hee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth ſuch kinde of learninge, whiche may in no wiſe of the learned be defended, and is ſkofte at of the ignorant. For he would that the minde of man ſhould be ſo firmely ſtaied and grounded vppon conſtancy, that it ſhoulde at no time ſo mutch as one iotte be moued. For he thinketh it an hainous faulte to be tormented wyth griefe or care, to be inclined to gratious fauour and mercy, to be inflamed with any deſire, to be prouoked with wrath, hatred or any perturbation of the minde. In this condicion of life, voide of all affection, which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call impaſſibilitye, hee thinketh the ſoueraigne good conteined: ſo that he which hath attained it, may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a man abſolutely wiſe, a Kinge, a bleſſed and happye man. Againe as touchinge the reſt, theym as ſottes, as ſeruile men ſteyned wyth all kinde of diſhoneſtye hee contemneth and nothinge regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Firſt and principally therefore whereas hee placeth felicity in the dignitye &amp; worthines of the ſoule of man, ſo that the vertue thereof can by no griefe of the body or pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge paine and calamity ſeuered from that bleſſed and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13981:53"/> happy eſtate of life: Herein he hath diſputed more ſtoutly and valiantly, then wiſely and truly. For whereas the minde is through the coniunction of mutuall loue faſt tied and vnited to the body, truely it can ſincke into no wyſe mans heade, as longe as they remaine one, if the bodye be through calamity afflicted, but that the minde eftſoones languiſheth and is diſquieted. If therefore the <hi>Stoikes</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is to bee folowed, teachinge vs that the heauines &amp; dolour of the minde worketh mans miſerye, then muſt it folow conſequently, except they will wreſt the truth from vs by violence, and tell vs that ſenſes are deceiued in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges moſt cleare and euident, that no man were he neuer ſo wiſe can attaine felicity, in trouble and vexation of body. For if we wanted our ſenſes, and that our bodye it ſelfe were not of our nature, then a man of meane perceyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce might be perſuaded, that he whoſe bodye were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with fire, were neuertheleſſe happy. But where as we conſiſt of body and ſoule, howe can we duringe this life ſuppoſe that to be felicity, which hath regarde only to one parte of vs, and in miſerable diſtreſſes leaueth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Eſpecially whereas by the neceſſarye operation of nature when the bodie feeleth paine, the minde ſuffereth the ſame. Therefore men of great wiſedome and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath not affirmed without great conſideration, that the appetite of anger and deſire hath bene ingraffed in our mindes for two cauſes: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myndes themſelues ſhould haue good regarde to preſerue thoſe bodies whoſe guides and keepers they ought to be. That is to witt that they ſhould by deſire for bodily ſuſtenaunce couet thinges méet and conuenient, and by anger ſhould eſchewe and auoyde thinges hurtefull and daungerous. Therefore whereas wrath and deſire are in vs by nature, it cannot be againe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide, when there is a ſhew of any excéedinge good fortune, or great euell imminent or likely to follow, but that oure
<pb facs="tcp:13981:54"/> myndes ſtirred vp with a kinde of more vehemency are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more redy with ioy and pleaſure to gratulate that which happely commeth to paſſe, either more ſtil and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to bewaile that, which hath vnfortunat y chaunced. And whereas this terrour of feare (that I omitt to ſpeake of any other paſſion) hath once by the wreſtlinge of nature aſſayled the minde, it hath ſtreight waies vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowen the <hi>Stoikes</hi> felicity which conſiſteth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſecurity. And that they conclude all matters with their owne argumentes, what can be ſhewed out of their writinges which may profit vs at all? no dought nothinge. For they bereue vs of the vſe of reaſon: Whereas they do vtterly abandon, and as it were plucke vp by the rootes all kindes of affections geuen vs by nature wherewith ſometimes we are quickned to the exerciſe of vertue. Howe cleare and apparant that is, I leaue at this time to ſpeake. For there is no man ſo very a dolt, but ſéeth how contrary it is to mans nature: and they that would driue into our mindes that aſtoniſhment, which the <hi>Stoikes</hi> call tranquility doe not determine mans felicity, but do vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſh and bury in vs all kinde of humanity. That therefore that is ſo manifeſt let vs omit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. And let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider howe profitable to the preſeruation of the ciuill ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of man that opinion is. Put the caſe that a rumour ſpread of the enemy comminge doth wonderfully terrefie the Citizens. The whole Cittie beinge aſtonied with feare taketh great care howe they may put from them the euell which maye enſue. In this caſe, the gouernours and cheife rulers will looke vnto the common ſafetye, the moſte couragious and luſtieſt men they will appointe ready in armes, garriſons they will ſet in order, all the reſte for the power and abylitye that euerye man hath wil diligentlye beſtirre themſelues to dryue from theire bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des the force of the enemye, which as a miſchiefe and that no ſmall miſchiefe they make accoumpte of. But

Agayne may we thinke him apte to rebuke offenders and wicked perſons ſharply, eyther to rewarde bountefullye men liuinge vertuouſlye, whiche is vtterly moued wyth no ſence of loue? or hatred. And that I may knitt vp all in one woorde, what ſhall hee profit the common ſotiety of man, which forgetteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee a man, and in a maner diuorceth himſelfe from humaine nature? For the affections of the mynde are to be cutt of by reaſon, not raſhly to be plucked vppe by the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. For the one is good and a profitable way, and by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes moderation maye bee obteyned: the other maye in no wyſe be compaſſed, and if it might, yet it were not ſo muche to be deſired.

Which hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted vnto him ſelfe ſuch boundes and limites, that he ordereth his life by the rule of nature and not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. As thoughe it were beeſides nature to lyue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: Or as though there were any thinge more agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to nature. To proue this, wherefore are we penſiue and carefull of thoſe thinges that happen to vs after our deathes? Wherefore doe we deſire ofſpringe and the ſucceſſion of children? Why do wee thinke it a worthye thinge to be commended to oure poſteritye? Whye are moſt pregnant and floriſhinge wittes moued with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of perpetuall fame and glory? Aſſuredly this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

For whereas man beinge a creature endued with reaſon and vnderſtandinge plainly and euidently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that, that is not to be thought to appertaine to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte bleſſednes, which is variable &amp; ſubiect to alteration: knowinge alſo for a certainty, that thoſe thinges whiche may be loſt or taken from vs are mutch diſagreinge with the nature of felicity, he dreadeth death, and is ſtirred vp wyth an egree motion of the mynde and moued wyth a wonderful inſtincte of nature, to couet the fruition of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. And beinge yet vncertaine to attaine the ſame, is duringe this life toſſed and turmoyled hither and thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and imployeth therto his whole ſtudy and diligence, that by all meanes he poſſibly may, he moughte preſerue himſelfe from vtter deſtruction and finall decaie. Some man therefore holdeth himſelfe moſt happy if he leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him after his death a perfecte portrayture of his owne name: and one that ſhall be as it were himſelfe in in another perſon. Some man ſtriueth excéedingelye by ſententious ſayinges and worthy monumentes of an excellent wit, by noble and valiaunt Actes to purchaſe to himſelfe continuall fame and memory. Some other in erectinge great and ſumptuous buildinges ſéeketh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to commende himſelfe vnto poſterity. Which geueth a ſufficient note, that euen by natures inſtincte and fore warninge all men tremble and quake at the memory of death, and then doe by all meanes ſheewe their deſire of perpetuity of life. Therefore whereas the nature of man is ſuch that it cannot haue on earth any longe conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance (for all kindes of eſtates are equally ſubiecte to death, and the way to the graue (as <hi>Horace</hi> ſaieth muſte once be trode) for this cauſe all men generally do apply therunto their whole diligence, after death at leaſt wiſe to leaue ſome repreſentation, or counterfaite ſhewe of life.

In the making where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he vſed no other engine or deuiſe, then his owne will &amp; pleaſure. For with God, the word is the fulfiller of all workes. And thus God bringeth to paſſe by his greate prouidence thoſe thinges at the length, which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted before all worlds. But firſt ſome man will aſke of mee this queſtion. To what purpoſe, and for whoſe vſe, that moſte highe creatour and Lorde of all thinges, hath made this ſo beautifull workemanſhippe, this ſo excellent forme and ſhape of heauenly bodies, this ſo large and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious greatnes of Sea &amp; Land? For it is not the practiſe of his infinite wiſedome to do any thing in vaine, &amp; to no end and purpoſe. For whoſe ſake then did he after a moſt wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful order, frame that moſt goodly &amp; ſeemely ſubſtance of thinges diſlike in nature, yet agreeing among themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues?
<pb facs="tcp:13981:61"/> for his own ſake thinke you? becauſe he would haue a trimmer habitacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin he mought more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly dwel? But it were not onely a wicked thing, but a point of extreme madnes, to thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cke ſo of that moſt bleſſed mind, then the which nothing more perfect and abſolute may be imagined, the vertue &amp; power wherof is infinite, to haue needed anye earthly &amp; bodily tabernacle, or that all times before he wanted ſome what to thee accompliſhing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte bleſſednes, or to the fulnes of his glory: or that God could be incloſed wythin any certaine roome or compaſſe. What then? were theſe things prouided for the Angels, &amp; ſaincts of God? In no wyſe: for they being ſeuered &amp; free from all felowſhip and coniunction of the body, deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but to behold their maker, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they reape any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, or conceiue any pleaſure of things beneath in theſe lowe parts. And to thinck this ſubſtanciall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip was made cheiefly for vnreaſonable creatures, or for the vſe of trees, &amp; plantes, it were a thinge to abſurde. For, were it not a thing farre vnſitting wyth the maieſty of God, to haue framed ſo great and wonderfull a worke for brute beaſtes, and creatures voyd of reaſon and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and therefore ioyned vnto him by no kinde of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie and likelines? God hath not therfore deuiſed this ſo goodly a frame for himſelfe, for Angels, for the fruites of the earth, for liuinge creatures voyde of reaſon, but for man made of body &amp; reaſonable ſoule, &amp; conſiſtinge of both thoſe natures co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might both with his outward ſences vew the excellent workemanſhip of the worlde, and alſo conceiue in minde deepely the exceding glory &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the workeman. Wherefore all the world with the beauty &amp; pleaſure therof, was ordeyned for the profite and vtility of man. Firſte and principally y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee mighte haue a dwelli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g place, wherin not onely the body ſhould be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed &amp; comforted wyth diuers &amp; ſondry fruits of the earth, which it abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly bringeth forth for the maintenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13981:61"/> ſuſtentacion of all lyuing creatures: but alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the minde obſeruing through vnderſtanding &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the works of Nature, with the varietie, pleaſure, and delectacion thereof, might by a proper &amp; peculiar foode, which chiefly conſiſteth in the manifeſte ſeinge of the truth, be fedde and receyue his ſolace and contentation. That when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſettled rule, and conſtant gouernment of ſo greate a woorke, ſhould ſtirre vp exceedingly the minde of man: it mought alſo induce him to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templacion of the chiefe and principall workeman. So that the goodly proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and frame of the worlde mighte be a ſchole and a certayne way and trade of learning, wherby man might be taught to honour and worſhip his lord &amp; maker. And thus it is cleare &amp; apparant, that the moſt high &amp; mighty God hath for mans ſake made and created fruites and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes, which the earth wyth wonderfull plenty yeldeth, ſenſible creatures, all maner of ſoyles whatſoeuer, the ſeas ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed wyth a groſſe and foggie aier, the heauens, the firmament, the ſterres, by whoſe gentle mouinges, much good happeneth to all lyuing creatures. Man was not as yet created, when God had prepared for him ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſo rich, ſo bountefull a kingdome. At length when the world it ſelfe was fully finiſhed he made man his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of earth, and be breathed thereinto a ſoule finely faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, accordinge to his owne Image and ſimilitude. Here may you ſee manifeſtly the originall and beginning of the moſt excellent &amp; noble ſoule of man, which being deriued and taken oute from no other thinge, then the ſpyrite of God, and being incloſed in the body as in a worthy veſſel, retayneth a deuine forme, pure, and deuoyde of all filthye corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Then the body was not infected wyth any vice, whereby reaſon mought be diſturbed, or the minde it ſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> darcknes ouerwhelmed. The firſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore knew all ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, vnderſtoode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes of all things, was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly learned in the rule and diſcipline of life, beinge inſtructed
<pb facs="tcp:13981:62"/> by no other teacher then God himſelfe, the giuer of all knowledge &amp; wiſedome. And he did not onely excel all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures in the comely ſhape &amp; feature of his bodye, but he was farre beyond them all, in the amiable, and the moſt excellent and deuine ſhape &amp; forme of the minde. For both parts thereof were wyth ſo ſinguler &amp; paſſing clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes enlightened: &amp; alſo vnited with ſuch concord &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcarcely any ſurer concord, or any more decent and ſeemely maner of comlines could be imagined. There was in the mind no errour, no motion in the ſence, wherby the rule of reaſon might be diſordered: whereas reaſon it ſelfe, as it were in a perfect &amp; flouriſhing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, ſo in a peaceable &amp; quiet eſtate coulde very eaſlie reſtraine all raging affections. The minde therfore had no kinde of let, and impediment wherby it might be hindered from daily contemplacion. But the vnderſtandinge &amp; capacitie of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being flouriſhing, quick, &amp; bent to the ſearch of highe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when it had found out and diſcuſſed the nature of all thinges that were contayned and as it were hidden in the ayre, the ſea, &amp; earth beneath, it was not ſatiſfyed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things which were vnder the circle &amp; ſphere of the Mone, and with thoſe things which mighte be ſeene, but woulde needes pearce the clouds, and ſearch the nature of heauen it ſelfe. And being thus made of ſo excellent a diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and nature, was alſo indued with thoſe vertues which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the common ſtate of man, by the exerciſe and fruition whereof he might be the more aſſured alwayes of the loue and grace of his lord &amp; maker. For the charecter &amp; figure of true &amp; perfect iuſtice, which prepareth the minde to all holines, &amp; is the moſt ſureſt bulwarke and defence therof was deepely imprinted in him. There was therein a firme and aſſured conſtancie of vertue, &amp; the exceedinge perfecte ſhape &amp; comlines of honeſtie it ſelf. Againe he had his wit tyed to no kinde of neceſſity, neither parcially inclined to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſe, nor intermedled with any kind of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13981:62"/> To be briefe, God hauing ſhewed himſelfe ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall &amp; bountefull towards man, he made him preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; chiefe ruler of the earth, &amp; appointed him a Princely place for his habitacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Grekes call it <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> a gardeine flowing with moſt pleaſaunt ſprings, moſt delectable, and decked with great ſtore &amp; varietie of ſweete ſmellinge flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, moſt fit to liue in, in all felicitie &amp; pleaſure. In this moſt pleaſaunt ſeate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was placed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by that place which they ſay was high and mounted alofte, he mought learne not onely like a ruler and gouernour, wyſely to guide the ſterne thereof: but alſo thereby be admoniſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diſcrete gouernment, &amp; free liberty, to take vppon him the charge and rule ouer all other lyuinge creatures. In the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which kingdome he folowed not a written law, but the law of nature: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is a moſt perfecte order, &amp; agreeable to the deuine nature of God, which they terme the chiefeſt and moſt ſoueraigne law of all other. Furthermore there was a promiſe made, a reward appointed that if he did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the gouernment aſſigned vnto him godly &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, he ſhould enter into that heauenly kingdome and euerlaſtinge bliſſe, the which in this life he would ſo much deſire. This was the firſt eſtate allotted and appointed to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this was the firſt beginning &amp; foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whereunto man aſpired: in which no man can note any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but that which is right honourable &amp; worthy of high eſtimacion. Whereby it is euidently to be perceiued what a miſerable miſte of darcknes auerwhelmed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of them, which hauing theyr ſoule created by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, (&amp; to ſpeake the vttermoſt) as it were proceedinge from the nature and ſubſtaunce of God himſelfe, ſuppoſe notwythſtandinge their felicity to be repoſed in thinges tranſitory and ſubiect to chaunge and alteration. It was therefore moſt wyſely ſayd of auncient Philoſophers, and of the Stoikes eſpecially, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beatitude and happines is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to liue a life correſpondent to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb facs="tcp:13981:63"/> But being ignorant what beſt did agree with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, it conſequently followed, that they coulde not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>efectly knowe what did appertaine to the nature of bleſſed life. Therefore that great ouerſighte and blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bread miſcheiuous errours, and was cauſe of manye wicked and deſperat opinons. For looke vnto what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man of himſelfe was leudly addicted, that ende, and felicity he vnto himſelfe appoyncted. For they that knew not part of themſelues to be immortall, and ſuppoſed the ſence of the ſoule to be extinguiſhed with the body, hunted after with all diligence and paine nothing els but things tranſitory, and appertaininge to their bodily ſubſtance. But they that ſawe ſomewhat, although through a miſte, thought not the deſired ende of mans life to conſiſt in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſubiecte to inconſtancy, and mutability, but rather in the qualities, and ritches of the minde. In this poyncte truly they ſayd well. But let vs vnderſtand what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ritches they ment. If thoſe which are borowed and deriued from no other but of God allmighty and are by his grace powred into our hartes, naye remaine all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in God himſelfe, in this opinion there is no oddes betwixt them and vs. But if they defend this learning, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> felicity conſiſteth in the vertues of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind, which through the ſtudy &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of many are attained &amp; after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deme all to be chiefely in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, herein they ſhew howe ignorant they are of their owne natures, &amp; are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de alſo moſt wicked and blaſphemous againſt God him ſelf. For they ſeeme not to vnderſtand that the ſoule is not of it ſelfe, but toke his beginninge of God, who referre the deſired ende of all their life not to God, but to their owne propre wit, &amp; vnderſtandinge, and beinge impudente and preſumptuduſly mynded, all their actions in their whole life which they ought to dedicate to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre and beſtow vpon ſettinge foorth their owne fame &amp; glory. If therefore true felicity, and the end
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13981:63"/> of our life is to be fixed in the cauſe and geeuer of life, there is no man ſo blinde, or ſelfewilled, but may eaſelye perceiue that he is to be of vs chiefly deſired, as the laſte ende of our actions, by whoſe benefit, aide, and helpe, wee came into the worlde, whome through a meruaylous and exceedinge inclination of nature wee feruently deſire, wee entirely loue, wée deſeruedly reuerence, worſhip, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie. Let vs therefore eftſones turne, and be ſpedilye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto that fountaine of all good thinges, that is euer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laſtinge &amp; can neuer be drawen dry, from whence we came, by whoſe grace we liue, &amp; are preſerued in our good eſtate. For it is not to be doubted when we haue ended our life in this world, we ſhal at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth enioy an endles &amp; moſt bleſted ſo that all that reſtleſſe deſire wherwith our mindes were inflamed, ſhalbe ſatiſfied, neither ſhall we haue any thinge els iuſtly to require. Wée muſt therefore referre all our doinges and actions to this ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we maye at the length haue the fruition of the higheſt and euer liuinge God. For if pleaſures do in any wiſe appertaine to perfecte bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then ſhall we with him enioy ſtable and permanente pleaſures, and thoſe which in no age ſhall decaie. But if our ſoueraigne good reſt in Sapience, then at the length ſhall that inſatiable deſire of tracinge and ſearchinge out the truth be ſatiſfied, when all darknes and obſcurity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge taken away, we ſhall not only contemplate &amp; beholde the perfect and true nature of each thinge, but him that is Lorde and Ruler of nature it ſelfe. And if longe life ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs happy, that is onely to be tearmed longe life whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is immortall, and not that which through age and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time is conſumed. Laſtly if they iuſtly thinke that quietnes and ſecurity muſt be a part of the definition of felicity, (for they holde this opinion that our life is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye and bleſſed when we are aſſured of thoſe good things wherewith it aboundeth ſhall longe continue.) If
<pb facs="tcp:13981:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> therefore without ſecuritie, wee cannot ſo much as vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what happines is, there ſhal we be ſure to be releaſed from all cares &amp; vexations, when no terrour, no ſodaine motions ſhal diſquiet vs, when we ſhal haue the moſt high and mighty God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> buckler of our defence, &amp; the preſeruer of our ſafety. But now I wil briefly conclude &amp; knit vp thoſe reaſons, which occaſioned me to fall into this kind of diſputacion. This was ſet downe by vs as a grounde and principle, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vertue was a certayne perfection of the mind, directing vs the right way to our laſt &amp; chiefe deſired end. Againe felicity (as it is declared) is no where to be put but in God alone. Then it foloweth by good reaſon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or affection of the minde can be ſayd vertuous, except it be aſcribed vnto God. Wherfore if neither felicitie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing which it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth may be thought fraile &amp; mutable (for it were a groſſe errour to thinck thoſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs happy &amp; bleſſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vaniſh away ſodainly) but aſſuredly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paſſing theyr times as they that are toſſed in a trouble te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, or ſea of waueri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g affections, no doubt men in no wiſe may be thought happy, except they be daily by the grace &amp; fauour of God ſtayed vp, &amp; protected. Againe it is of all men confeſſed, that vertue is the meane whereby wee are conducted &amp; ledde to felicitie, and therefore that is not to be taken for a vertue that doth not ioyne vs to God, and is not referred to him alone. And therin onely conſiſteth the worthines of true vertue, where all other are in no wiſe to be eſteemed as vertues, but the ſhadowes &amp; falſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaytes of vertue. For by what reaſon ſhould we giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of vertue vnto that, which hath not prefixed before it an end of bleſſednes? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth that <hi>Diomedes,</hi> was in no wyſe puiſſaunte eyther ſhewed anye pointe of manhoode and true magnanimitie, when the Grekes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to flighte hee remayned behinde alone, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyth daunger of his perſonne ſtande agaynſte the force of <hi>Hector,</hi> then to beare the ignomye of a Turne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13981:64"/> &amp; ranne awaie. I praye you whie ſo? Was it not a noble acte and worthy of greate honour, when <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> beinge relinquiſhed of his friendes and countrimen, himſelfe alone or with a very fewe, ſtoode to his tacklinge, thinking it better to die manfully, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue wretchedly, makinge more accoumpte of his glorye and eſtimation, then of his ſafety, and preſeruation? No doubte it was very well done (quoth he) but for that <hi>Diomedes</hi> in hys enterprice ſought not ſo mutch true praiſe, as the vayne brute of the people, (for he feared mutch leaſt that <hi>Hector</hi> in the middeſt of his glory would the more triumphe, if he might ſaie, he had put <hi>Diomedes</hi> to flighte) he therefore purchaſed not due prayſe of vertue. In like manner <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> iudgeth of <hi>Hector,</hi> for that he openly confeſſed that he tooke great care leaſt that the men and women of <hi>Troye</hi> woulde ſpreade any rumour ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and therefore would more boldly and couragiouſlye venture his life in battaile. This man of ſingular wit and learninge, iudged them not to haue deſerued the title of true honour and vertue, for becauſe they did not reſpecte true &amp; perfect honeſty, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he thought ſhould be conſidered as the principall and chiefe ende of our life, and therefore remoueth them from that ordre and degree that vertue purchaſeth: and placeth theym in a ſeconde roome, in which he repoſeth that counterfaite image of vertue, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che bringeth vs to do our office and duety through an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſire of glory, and is conteined within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of law, and ciuill diſcipline. The ende therefore (accordinge to <hi>Ariſtoteles</hi> opinion) proueth euery Acte to be honeſt, or diſhoneſt, ignoble, or honourable. For one, and the ſelfe ſame action may be taken in hande, whereby ſometimes great eſtimation, ſometimes no ſmall diſcredit and ſhame is procured, according to the diuerſity of the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent and purpoſe. Whereby it foloweth neceſſarily y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they onely may be termed ſtoute and valiaunt men, whiche ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
<pb facs="tcp:13981:65"/> reſpect to the true ende of vertue, worthely die the death: and they that regarde rumoures and vaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes of the people, and for that refuſe not to endaunger themſelues, are to be eſtéemed as vaine and light: but they that through ſome naughty and vnlawfull deſire, or ſome lewde and vicious perturbation of the minde, are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red vp to do ſome valiant enterprice, are of all other to be holden moſt wicked. Whereby it is concluded that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hector,</hi> nor <hi>Diomedes</hi> were to be commended for their prowes and puiſſance, and that <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> were not only not valiante, but worthy of all ſhame and diſhonour. For the one in defence of an infamous, and wicked marriage came forth into the fielde, the other ſhed ſo mutch bloude, and made that great ſlaughter of his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies, only to quench, and ſatiſfy the immoderate angre and rage of his mind. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> may be with al conuinced of the ignorance of true magnanimitye &amp; fortitude, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he could not, beinge ouerwhelmed with the like cloude of blindnes, vnderſtande what felicity was, from whence the conſtancie and ſtability of vertue, and the decent ſeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of honeſty iſſueth and floweth. But you will ſaye he hath written many thinges of God, ſhewinge therein great wiſedome and learninge. I knowe that very well. But (I pray you) what place hath he aſſigned him in the makinge and creatinge of all thinges appertaininge to man? For whereas he denieth the world euer to haue bene made, in deede this one onely office he appoynteth to God to moue the worlde aboute the <hi>Pole</hi> with a wonderfull ſwiftnes. By the conuerſion and turninge whereof, the chaunges, and courſes, Generations, and corruptions of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l thinges vnder heauen are made. Againe there were many of great learninge and iudgemente which ſuppoſed the worlde to bee ruled not by fortune, or any meanes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, but by the deuine prouidence and ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God. But not ſo, that they either thought that vertues procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from him or that the deſired ende of our life ſhoulde
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13981:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> reſt in him. Therefore what auaile their inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t opinions of God duſked &amp; defaced w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo manifold errours to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our laſt deſired ende? For yf they confeſſed an eternall &amp; euerlaſting God, forced thereunto through beholdinge the meruaylous and exceedinge beauty of the worlde, and the wonderfull order of heauenly bodies, yet for all that, they did not due honour vnto him, neither dyd put in him the hope of a bleſſed and happy life. Therefore none of the whole packe of them, either could beholde the end of our life, or could perceyue in their mindes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte fourme of vertue, deſiringe rather the ſhadowe and counterfaite, then the plaine and liuely image of nobility, repreſentinge it more in a glorious oſtentation and bragge of wordes, then fullfillinge it abſolutely in their maners and life. To conclude, if that onely may be iuſtly iudged true vertue, which bringeth vs to perfecte felicitye, it is moſt cleare (which alſo hath bene proued ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that, that onely is to be taken for vertue which lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp our mindes intentiuely and with great affection to the beholding of God euerlaſtinge, the beginninge and ende of all thinges. Whereuppon this may alſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently folowe that all honoure, and true noblenes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth light and beauty of that moſt excellent and notable vertue. But all nobility whatſoeuer, if it do not iſſue and ſpring out of this diuine vertue, albeit it hath a faire ſhew gliſtereth gaiely, neuertheleſſe in very deede it is vaine &amp; mutable, neither can it participate the nature of perfecte and true nobility. And no doubt that race and kinred, in which that heauenly kinde of vertue appeareth, may not ſo much be thought to fetch his deſcent &amp; genealogy from men, as to ſpring out of ſome celeſtiall and diuine genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore after I haue declared the fall and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the firſt man, I will manifeſtly diſcourſe vnto you, the worthy notes and properties of this diuine and celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al kinred. For the declaration of that calamity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13981:66"/> wherwith the firſt parent of all mankind being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed fell, will conteine the cauſe of that error, &amp; cloude of ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wherwith the minds of men ouerwhelmed, ſo many ages lay hidden in darcknes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither they could behold any heauenly light, neyther ſufficiently conſider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worthines of true Nobility. Wherby it came to paſſe that Nobility being vtterly extinct in ſteede thereof ſucceded an abiect minde, and a vile eſtate, rude, baſe, &amp; barbarous. After theſe ſo many and wonderful miſcryes be layed ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and euidently knowen, then will it more clearely appeare by what meanes wee were againe reſtored to our former dignity, &amp; how we againe recouered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name &amp; worthines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we afore loſte.</p>
               <p>TO returne therfore to man, he (as it was, declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) was placed in the earth, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he ſhould be lord &amp; owner thereof. Againe that he ſhould gouerne all lyuing creatures, &amp; behold the heauen aboue with al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and dutifull reuerence. He had therefore a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuriſdiction ouer the earth, he ſerued onely the Lord of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; being a holy one wholy dedicated to God, he was the expounder of his holy will and pleaſure: and the chiefe Prince &amp; firſt parent of al mankind. Who hauing in body a moſt comely &amp; goodly perſonage, in minde notwythſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge attayned to honour due to celeſtiall creatures, in ſo much that throughe a heauenly inſpiration, he could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew many thinges to come. And thus naked he wandred in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſweete and delectable gardeine. For neither wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted he any kinde of veſture to cloth himſelf, whom the ſharpenes of no kinde of weather could greeue &amp; offend, neither had he about him any ſtaine, &amp; vnſeemely thinge, for the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and hiding wherof, he might be carefull. And hee had a law giuen him that he ſhould exerciſe that free will that was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him in the practiſe of vertue, that at length hee myghte by hys owne demerits deſerue to bee of the

               <p>God gaue him this commaundement not that he diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he had manifoldly bleſſed, ſhould haue the vnderſtandinge thereof, but that by that meanes hee woulde the better forſee and prouide thoſe thinges which apperteined to his good eſtate, and preſeruation. For he knewe ryghte well, that if man were ſette at libertye, hee wooulde ſtrayght way worke his owne confuſion. So therfore God did moderate his libertye, that hee agayne myght reſtreine the ſame by a very neceſſarye and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lawe. Neither did hee ſo muche forbidde him to eate of that fruite, as that he ſhoulde not ſlippe in to that, which by that fruite was meante, and ſignifyed. For whither this was ſignifyed, that he ſhould not meddle with thoſe cauſes, or ſearch by his own induſtry to attayn the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe thinges whiche his capacitye coulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache and compriſe: Or that he ſhould not in the choyſe of good, and refuſall of yll, vſe rather his owne iudgement, then the will and pleaſure of the almighty, by whoſe wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he ſhoulde yeelde hymſelfe to be gouerned: or this that hee ſhoulde not inclyne him ſelfe to the loue of thoſe good things whiche are mixt and intermedled wyth a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of euills (For in the ſcriptures to knowe, is earneſtly to deſire and followe:) Therefore I ſaye whither he gaue that commaundemente to man that hee embracinge that ſoueraygne good, that is not entermedled with any euill, ſhoulde vtterly refuſe other good thinges whiche appeare faire and pleaſant, and yet are corrupt and poyſoned, what more wholſom precept and commaundement might haue ben ordeined more profitable for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

I ſaye therfore when the deuill ſaw man made of earth, aſcende vnto that place of glory, from whence he fel, he through enuie wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whote and imagined all kynd of craftes and ſuttelties, to deſtroye and vtterlye ouerthrowe the ſtate of mankynd.

Thus the woman neglectinge the

This was the original and beginning of the miſery of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this was the roote of all euills. Herehence proceeded death &amp; immortality, which afterwardes increaſed more &amp; more and with moſt cruell tyranny oppreſſed all the world. For as ſoone as man had yeelded himſelfe by ſufferance, to bee corrupted with the filthy contagio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that foule fault, that euill immediatly ranne to the vaynes: and ſearched euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verye bowels of the bodye, and at one time did ſlea &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both bodye and ſoule.

And whereas briers and brambles (which by the commaundement of God, the Earth brought forth to his paine) pricked his body: yet mutch more tormented was his minde, beinge wounded with the remembraunce of his heynous contempte, and tranſgreſſion, and with the ſecret knowledge of his faulte within his owne conſcience, which kinde of remorſes, and gripinge griefes woulde ſuffer him to take no delight in worldely pleaſure, and did continually drawe aſide all his cogitacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the deſire of his former felicity, &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible feelinge of his preſent miſerye.

               <p>This was the miſerable wretchednes and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſfortune of oure firſte parente, into the which hee fell headelonge, in that, yeeldinge vnto the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſerpent, he forſooke his ſoueraigne Lorde and God.

Therefore all poſteritye hath ſuffered through him a greuous, and deadly wounde. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our vnderſtandinge and reaſon is not a litle decayed

The image therefore of our firſt father ſufficiently expreſſed in this ſo greate changeablenes and frailty of minde and body, dyd ſow in vs the ſeede of all other miſchiefes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> afterwards dyd inuade the children of men. For firſte of all when thoſe outragious affections had by litle and lyttle diminiſhed &amp; ouercome the power of our vnderſtandinge, then was yt apparant that man his countenaunce aduanced and lifted vp to heauen, nowe beinge diſgraced was more proue to looke on the Earth, and beinge thereon fullye fixed, repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the confidence and ſtaye of his eſtate in vaine and worldly goods. Therefore the loue of honeſty, the glorye and honour of true nobility muſt of neceſſity decay, and be extinguiſhed vtterly by the neglecte and contempt of that chiefe and ſoueraigne good, in which remaineth the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and perfection of all true honour and godlines. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vſe and cuſtome of ſinninge increaſed, &amp; dayely grewe to greater force, and was founde more aboundant, it came to paſſe that no horrible acte could be imagined, whither it proceeded of luſte and concupiſcence, or of raginge furye, and impudent boldnes, wherewith man defiled not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Neither did it ſuffice him to committe all kinde of villanies whereby faith and the leage of common ſociety might be hindred: but he fought againſt God moſt high,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13981:69"/> by pollutinge his relligion, and violatinge his holy lawes and ordinaunces. For whereas their mindes were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with darkenes, they coulde not eaſely compriſe the nature of any thinge excepte they had a certaine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the eye, either ſome other external ſenſe of the body might geue them knowledge thereof.

The which thinge verelye hath bin practiſed not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Barbarians, but alſo where learning and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie hath bin profeſſed. For both the <hi>Rhodians</hi> who for credite of learninge were ſuppoſed to haue <hi>Minerua</hi> their Patroneſſe, did offerre in their yearely Sacrifice a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Saturne.</hi> And almoſt all the Grecians, before they would marche on towards the fielde, woulde after a moſt deteſtable and horrible maner defile the Aulters and Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wyth manſlaughter. And the <hi>Romaynes</hi> thoughe not often, yet ſometimes wyth men offerred vppe in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, thoughte good to appeaſe the wrath of their Gods. Wherefore litle is it to be marueiled at, if the <hi>Thracians,</hi> the Frenchmen, the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and other Nations, at that time voyde of all humanity and good ciuility, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and well liked of thoſe Sacrifices, by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and motion of euill ſpyrites, which conſiſted in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and effuſion of bloude. And to ſpeake of <hi>Diana</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in <hi>Scithia,</hi> which was neuer ſatiſfyed wyth bloude (that I mighte let paſſe the other cruell Gods of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles) it is manifeſte that the Princes of <hi>Phaenicia</hi> in the greate calamities of their country, were wonte butcherly to kill for ſacrifice that childe which they moſt entierly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtoryes doe witneſſe alſo that this was the maner in <hi>Scythia,</hi> that parents layinge aſide all good Nature, and fatherlye loue and pitie, were wonte to appointe, and as it were conſecrate their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the fire. But what do I ſtaye in this matter, whereas it is deliuered vnto vs by the handes of manye wryters, that almoſt no ſacrifice was done by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome notable and great impietie. In fine it came to paſſe that a wonderfull immunitie and liberty in ſinning, followed that outragious furie and wickedneſſe.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13981:70"/> For whereas it is the propertye of true religion to keepe men within the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of dutye, after that, that religion was publiſhed &amp; allowed which did not only ſet at naught all dutyes appropried and belonginge to honeſt ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and good humanitye, but alſo brought men to this o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pynion that the Godes were pleaſed in vnlawfull luſtes, in bloudſhedinge, in wilfull and horrible murder: nowe it coulde not be choſen, but that al men in general thus deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately ſet, ſhoulde defyle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with al kind of beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and deteſtable villany. In the ende it came to paſſe that ſinne takinge roote, and beginninge of the deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, then increaſed by vſe, laſtly perfyted and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed by vncleane and vile religion, ſhould worke the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vndoinge, and ouerthrow of all mankynde. But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſome man wil ſay what of al this? do you think in that greate wracke and decay of vertue, to haue ben re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning not one ſigne, or relique of true nobility, neyther any one man of thoſe auncient tymes, to haue giuen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ſtudie and loue of honeſtye? I cannot denye but manye in that common miſerye of man haue bene allured through that counterfayt ſhewe of honeſty, and haue bene after a ſorte ſtirred vpp to the exerciſe and practyze of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. There was no doubte, there was the image and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of God imprinted in the mynde of man, diſgraced through ſinn not clerely put out, and vtterly extinguiſhed. And when thou heareſte the image of God, thou muſt not thinke I meane any ſuche picture as might be paynted by <hi>Protogenes</hi> in a table or curiouſly ſette out in couloures by <hi>Apelles,</hi> or any other reſemblance of anye thinge made in yuorie by ſom exquiſite craftesma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which might repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuely image of God, For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of god is nothing els but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; folowinge of his vertue, as near as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſible may.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priſe many things, quick and ſharp, conteining within it ſelfe all ſeedes and cauſes of vertue. Therefore whereas
<pb facs="tcp:13981:71"/> we are by the handie work of God thus made and created, nothing is more agreing to our nature, and conſtitution, then true worthines and honeſty. And if ſo be that we had bene from the beginninge free from the infectious conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of ſinne and iniqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But whereas the multitude of thoſe ſo many miſchiefes conſpyring together ſeketh the ſpoyle of this image of God, it is moſt commonlye lead away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good inclination of nature: and then falleth oute that contencion and as it were ciuil broyle, in which reaſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with a certayne glimſe and ſimilitude of diuine nature oftentymes victoriouſlye triumpheth: but is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more times lead captiue and yeeldeth to beaſtlines and ſenſuality, yet ſo, that it leaueth ſome certayne ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of doloure and grief in that ſtriuing and as it were drawinge backe, it is caried away from vertue and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Whiche manifeſtlye proueth that the ſparcke and grace of vertue maye bee throughe ſome lewde luſte and outragious concupiſcence enfeebled, but neuer ſubdued. For no man hath euer bin ſo exceedinglye giuen to licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, either ſo dronken wyth the dregges of ſenſuality, but as ſoone as that wauering and wilfull pleaſure (the miſtie vapoure whereof had bleared the eyes of his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge) was vaniſhed, waxing heauie, crucifying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe through ſorrowe and lamentation, he was in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence greuouſly tormented.

For albeit they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a certayne kynde of worthy renoume, yet what true worthines was, they knewe not, when they neuer looked vp into heauen, whence wee oughte to fetche al true and perfect vertue.

No doubt in vayn. For they carefully embraced that vertue, that was fayre and

Neyther could they be deliuered from theſe ſtraunge maladies of the ſoule wherewith they were miſerablye entangled, whereas it was not in their owne power to helpe themſelues: and God both the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and laſt ende of all vertue, by whoſe onely vertue, they mought obtayn it, they did not with the eyes of their mynd ſufficiently beholde. Therfore there reigned in that age no true vertue but the falſe and counterfayte forme of vertue: no true and perfect worthines, but the vayne ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of worthines: no true deſire of renomne, but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed, vnruly and fonde luſting after fame and glorye. All whiche trulye were not ſo muche incited with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, &amp; delectable ſhape of honeſty it ſelfe as that they mought mounte vp to the ſtate of honour, and with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be reuerenced of the people, did take in hand thoſe notable and famous actes.

Notwithſtandinge the nature of true and perfect Godlines was not expreſſed in their law, but ſuch a kinde of honeſtie, which mighte ſeeme to haue bin not abſolute and entire good, but rather an vnfini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and rude ſhape of honeſty. No doubt it reſtrayned men from many wicked, and wilfull enterpryſes, it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode furious madnes and impietie, it did ſeuerelye and ſharpely puniſhe offenders, yet did it not leade and guide any man to the perfecteſt and higheſt ſteppe of vertue and wyſedome. For they were prouoked to the loue of vertue, not by the incitinge and allurement of vertue it ſelfe, but partly by dread and feare, partly by prefermente, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſuche as did ſurpaſſe all other in innocencie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of lyfe. For whereas they ſawe in the firſte or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce &amp; eſtabliſhment of the Law, flames of fire flaſhe out in euery part of Heauen, the Earth, and aire to quake wyth the vehemente and terrible ratlinge of thunder, ſtraunge lighteninges fall from the firmament, through the flakes and flames whereof the higheſt mountayne on euery ſide was ſet on fire, beſides the dreadfull ſounde of the trumpette, the wonderfull ſmokes and thicke miſtie cloudes, and the reſt of thoſe terrible aſpectes which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declared the maieſtie of the Godheade it ſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente: thus beinge marueylouſly daunted wyth feare, and ſtriken with aſtoniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wyth lowde voyce they call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Moſes.</hi> Speake thou (ſay they) vnto vs, and wee will eftſones giue eare vnto thee.

But vnto all this what aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth <hi>Moſes?</hi> He biddeth them to be of good courage, and giueth them to vnderſtand the prouident will of God. <hi>Feare you not</hi> (quoth he) <hi>for God is come to proue you,
<pb facs="tcp:13981:73"/> and that you ſhould ſtande in awe of him, and that you ſhould ſinne no more.</hi> Which in effecte ſoundeth thus. As yet you are not by the will and appointmente of God free from wicked deſiers, &amp; from other euill affections of the mind: neyther are you ſuch which of your owne good nature will be broughte to honeſty and Godlines. This terrour therfore God hath ſtriken into your mindes, that at the leaſt by that meanes he mighte reſtrayne you from your wilfull and wicked wayes. But wyth what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doth he allure them to the exerciſe of vertue? Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth the ſame almoſt doth hee intice them, the which the rude and ignorant multitude doth ſo much deſire &amp; wiſh, wyth plenty of corne, wyth aboundance of riches, wyth ſounde and perfect health of the body. But if that be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be termed vertue, which not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned by feare, but by a mere voluntary motion doth her office and duty, and taketh anye worthy enterprice in hande not for the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge tranſitory thinges in this life, but becauſe it direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe to God the finall ende of life in deede, then how may that he deemed a vertue which is by feare forced and wreſted oute, whoſe ende and felicity is put not in the true worſhipping of the euerlaſting God, but in the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coueting of worldly commodities? I would not haue thoſe hereby ſignifyed, who hauing more experience of the frailty of man his nature, righte wyſely vnderſtoode that they coulde not of themſelues perfourme thoſe thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were commaunded in the lawe, except they ſhoulde ſeeke refuge at Gods hands, the onely ſtay of ruling &amp; guidinge their liues aright. For they that farre paſſed all other in rare and ſingular wyſedome, had no confidence in theyr owne naturall ſtrength, and did put their whole truſte in God, and being confirmed wyth the power of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, came to the higheſte perfection of vertue. Who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge were fewe in nomber. All the reſt, who ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaned to much to their owne reaſon and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13981:73"/> or for worldly reſpects did their duties, could by no meanes purchaſe renowne, to vertue due and appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, neyther could any longe time becauſe of the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and imbecilitie of their minds, continue in good liuing, nay rather fell headlong into great and horrible impietie, beinge intangled and ſnared with wicked deſires, and the entiſements of moſt filthy pleaſures. Beſides this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them when they had defiled and polluted themſelues with the foule and ſhameful ſtinkinge ſinne of any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition whatſoeuer, they were in that deſperate ſtate and condition, that no outragious &amp; deteſtable villanie could be imagined, which they willingly woulde not committe, in ſo much that they would throw their naturall children into flaming fire, in honour of their falſe &amp; fayned Gods. Of this ſo great and notable impietie, furie, and madnes, many holy and worthy fathers complaine, but eſpecially <hi>Ieremie</hi> moſt lamentably aboue all other. For example, when he ſpeaketh in the perſon of God thus: <hi>They haue broughte their wickednes into my houſe, in which my name is called vpon, that they might pollute it, and that they might builde alters in Tophet, which is in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the ſonne of Ennom, there to deſtroy their ſonnes and daughters vvith fire.</hi> And agayne, <hi>This place ſhall not hereafter be called Tophet, and the valley of the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Ennom, but the valley of murther, And I vvill bringe to noughte the Counſaile of Iuda and Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in this place, and I vvill cutte them vvith the ſword in the ſight of their ennemies.</hi> Theſe wordes ſpake <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie.</hi> But it is not neceſſary to rippe vppe the rable of thoſe miſchiefes, with the which that Nacion was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, through the corruption whereof, true beliefe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and relligion ſubuerted, the law of God brought in contempt, and by the meanes of luſt and ſuperſtition, tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder foote.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the crime to be valued alike in him that hath had no kinde of inſtruction and learning, as in him, who to all kinds of vertue hath bin by the lawes of God trayned and directed.

Who truly was not ſo much incenſed againſt man in the correction &amp; puniſhment of his heynous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would cleane blot and race out of his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the moſt excellent image of himſelf, imprinted in man. But rather for the excedinge greatnes of his offence, vſed a milde and gentle chaſtiſement: and alſo appointed to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a paine, as whereby hee ſoughte not ſeuere reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his impietie: but to applie to his diſeaſe, a holſome medecine and remedie, &amp; to recall him againe to vertue &amp; honeſtie. But it was neceſſary by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of righteouſnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome, whoſe weldoinge through their intollerable pride and ſtubbernes, was not to bee hoped for, ſhoulde feele the whippe &amp; ſcourge of ſeueritie, onely to be a terrour vnto other: and they beinge an example vnto them, it fell out y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> manye returned from their wicked wayes, &amp; by that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the nomber was farre greater of thoſe that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the loue and mercie of God, then complaine of his ſharpe and ſeuere iudgemente. To conclude after ſinne and wickednes was once committed, all meanes poſſible were deuiſed, to heale y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feſtered ſoore, by ſinne procured. There were laid forth menacing threatninges, there was ſente amonge men death and deſtruction, generall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming of waters, great waſte &amp; hurt by fire. Againe, there happened ſtraunge ſights &amp; prodigious monſters, to feare and terrifie the minds of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Further the broiles and tumults of warre, the vtter ruine and ſubuerſion of countryes, had this meaninge to ſtrike into men ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of ſinne, and to withdraw them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wickednes &amp; abhominacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. On the other ſide the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of this life, the law ſet downe by the finger of God, the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy religion, Gods promiſes, his exceedinge benefits, were to reduce men both to their dutie, &amp; to the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theyr owne health &amp; ſafetie. God therfore of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and fatherly clemencie, goodnes, and mercye, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the ſafegarde and preſeruation of man his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by all kinde of meanes, whether they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But after that the extremitie of his ſickenes ſo much increaſed, and his wickednes waxed ſo great, that his wounded ſoule ſeemed almoſt incurable, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe and principall of all Phiſitions, applyed vnto him another ſoueraigne medecine, and gaue vnto him an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preſeruation, not onelye to repayre that which was impayred, and loſt by diſeaſe, but alſo fully to reſtore his former healthe, with further encreaſinge the ſame wyth ſtrength, and all other neceſſary ſupplies. This no doubt was the wyſedome of Almighty God, the eternall ſonne of the father eternall, begotten in ſuch wyſe as no tongue can declare, the perfect image of his fathers glory, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; welſpring of life &amp; immortalitie. He therfore who had in the beginning of the worlde, imprinted in man the ſhape and liklines of himſelfe, hath loſed him which was bound wyth fetters of ſinne &amp; death, &amp; compaſſed about w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al kinde of miſery &amp; calamitie, and hath by his ſinguler &amp; diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce reſtored him to his former liberty. Firſt therefore it was expediente and neceſſary that, that abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and moſt haynous offence wherewith mankinde generally was infected, ſhould be waſhed away: and that the violating and defacing of the relligion of God ſhoulde be by ſome holy ſacrifice or ſatiſfaction raunſomed, &amp; that the filthie ſtaine by wickednes and ſinne receyued, ſhoulde be clenſed, and cleane taken out. That at the length man beinge thus deliuered from the bondage and tyrannie of ſinne, mought recouer the worthy titles of his aunciente dignity and renowme, and in the ende attayne the glory of lyfe euerlaſtinge. But no ſuch ſacrifice coulde poſſiblye be found, by which ſo great impietie might be purged, or the iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God ſatiſfyed, or the ſtaine receyued, quite and cleane taken oute, and waſhed awaye.

               <p>Their vertue with a waueringe hoope and fainte courage thinketh on their glory.

But this I ſuppoſe not out of the way to warne you of that they are not diuerſe families and kinredes in which we repoſe this holy and godly nobility. For although they are by bloud ſeuered, by eſtate and condicion diuerſe, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diſtinct places infinite: yet after they are into one place aſſembled, to the intent they ſhould ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues valiant ſouldiars vnder their cheife, and generall Captayne <hi>Chriſte,</hi> they are incontinently tyed together, &amp; vnited with one bloude of kinred, and conſanguinity. For they haue nowe laide aſide all alliaunce and proximity of bloude, by which afore they were ſeuered, and beinge adopted into the houſe and kinred of God, in which there is no diſtinction of birth, they are nowe equall and all a like Gentlemen. For after that they being inwardly ſanctified by the outwarde ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water in the holy ſacrament of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> for moſt parte had renounced the olde vſe and cuſtome of ſinne, and had laid aſide the prince and image of our firſt father, and leauinge their former life, and beinge as it were borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, began to enter into a newe life, there was wrought incontinently a newe diſpoſition of the mynde of man, and there did ſpringe vp and ariſe therein a wonderfull perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and excellencye of nature: ſo that no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The firſt beginning of our race and kinred (as it is afore declared) is God himſelfe, at whoſe becke all thinges were made, &amp; are preſerued in their good eſtate, vnto whom all thinges are caried with a deſire paſſinge mans cogitation &amp; credit.

               <p>THere was in tyme paſt an oyntment of greate holines and vertue, white wonderfull ſolemne ceremonyes made, wherwith they that were ordeined Pryeſtes, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Prophets were wont to be annointed. And that it was lawfull for no man to enter into prieſthode, eyther to take vppon him the maieſty and aucthority of a Kinge, except he were anoynted with this holye oyntment, it is a thinge more commonly known then that itne deth by any man more amply to be diſcourſed. And how Prophets ſhould haue the ſame, poured vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them it appeareth by the

For ther <hi>God commaunded Elias to annoynt Ahael and Iehu, and to create one king of Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ria, the other of Samaria</hi> Further he addeth. <hi>Thou ſhalt anoynt Helizeus the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of Saphat and appoynt him a Prophet in thy roome.</hi> It was not therefore at that time lawfull neyther to execute the office and dutye of a kinge, nor to enter into holy orders of Pryeſthode, nor for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phettes ſometimes by diuine inſpiration to foretel things to come, or to enterprete any difficulte or ſecrete miſterye, except they had beene before with this oyle anoynted, and conſecrated. Not truely becauſe there was that vertue in <hi>Caſſia</hi> or <hi>Cinamome</hi> or other ſweet odoures tempered with oyle, that without them wee ſhould thinke no man able to attayne honour and ſoueragnetye. But no doubte ther was another kynd of oyle ſecret and ſpyrituall, wher of this compounde deuiſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was but a ſhadowe and outwarde ſigne, without whiche no man could as his eſtate required gouern a kingdome, no man vncorruptly exerciſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt holy functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Prieſthode, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the diuine ſpirite of Propheſie,, foretel things to come. For no other thinge is this kynde of oyle, but the ayde and aſſiſtance of the holy ſpyrite alwayes at hand, and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gift by Gods gratious goodnes beſtowed vpon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and vndefyled myndes, by the power whereof many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydinge here in earth, haue after a ſort obteyned, the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and condicion of heauenly wightes. This is that oyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith Chriſte was waſhed from top to toe as it is written. <hi>The ſpirite of God reſteth vppon me, for that he hath anoynted me.</hi> But <hi>Daniell</hi> doth not onelye Prophecye of the annoyntinge, but ſheweth that it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted within the ſpace of iii. ſcore and x weekes within which tyme it ſhould come to paſſe that the ſtayne of ſinne ſhould be cleane waſhed away, and the gilte of impyetye ſatiſfied, and the chefe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are called holy, ſhould

Which is more plainly in another place declared in this wiſe. <hi>Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath anoynted</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>with the holy ghoſt and vertue</hi> And whereas al thoſe functions which haue bene of olde time in ſome ſigne ſignifyed, &amp; beſtowed on diuers men, were after a moſt excellente order and all at ones to be beſtowed on Chriſt. For his euerlaſtinge kingdom, his moſt high prieſthode, was by diuine oracles foretoulde and he was called many hundred yeares afore the excellent Prophet: ſeyng therfore he was after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull order to bee magnified with all glory, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced aboue all men to the higheſte eſtate of honoure: meete it was that aboue all other partakers of the ſame inheritance, and glory, he ſhoulde be annoynted. As it is wrytten in the boke of Pſalmes <hi>Thovv haſt loued righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuouſnes and hated iniquity, therfore God euen thy God hath annoynted the vvith the oyle of gladnes aboue thy felows. A drop of Myrrh, and Caſſia hath deſtilled from thye garmentes.</hi> He therefore aboundinge with ſweete ſmelles, and precious oyntmentes, and therefore called by the name of Chriſt, beyng appoynted kinge of kinges, and aduaunced to the higheſte dignity of Prieſthode, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all determinations and purpoſes of God, &amp; being the dealer and worker in them, ſo gouerneth all thinges, that he obteineth for vs at Goddes handes peace &amp; attone<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and inſpyreth into our myndes all good leſſons and precepts of wiſedome &amp; things far beyond y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reach and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of mannes knowledge. Therfore all thoſe worthy tytles of Power, holines, and ſpirituall perfection in this one name of Chryſte are conteined. Seeynge therfore of that whiche plenteouſly abounded in Chriſte or kinge, ſome parte was alſo deriued vnto them that walked in his
<pb facs="tcp:13981:84"/> wayes, and folowed his aucthoritye whom he calleth bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, companions, pertakers of all thoſe good thinges that ſhould be geuen vnto himſelf, therefore of good right the name of Chryſte was applyed to theym, and they were tearmed Chriſtians, eyther becauſe they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Chriſte, or becauſe, they weere partakers of the ſame annoyntinge. For thus it is written in Iohn <hi>You haue the annoyntinge from the holye one and you knovv all thinges.</hi> And agayne ſhortlye after hee ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>The annoyntinge that you receyued of him remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in you: no neede haue you of anye man to teache you, but his annoyntinge ſhall teach you all thinges.</hi> Wheras therefore the vertue and efficacie of this annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſuche that it is able to creat kinges, to make Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtes &amp; to inflame the harts of al men with heauenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it is no doubte, but that al true Chriſtians are par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>takers of the perfection of all thoſe worthye and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable functions: for they are not onelye kinges, or choſen to bee pryeſtes as <hi>Iohn</hi> wryteth in his <hi>Apocalipſe,</hi> but they haue alſo a wonderfull knowledge of the hidden and ſecrete miſteryes of God. For more iuſtly maye you cal hym a kinge (that here I mought omitte to ſpeake of the incomparable riches of that eternall and ſpirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) which vſeth the reſtraint of the Law of God to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate his luſtfull deſires, and to brydle the euyll affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and vices of the minde, and directeth all his actions to the princely precepts, and royall rules of Chriſt then hym that liueth in Princely aucthoritye, and lyke a vyle drudge, is a bond ſlaue to ſhame and ſin. More iuſtlye may youe call hym a pryeſte whoſe holye and deuoute prayers doth farre, and by a great many degrees excell in reſpecte of the perfection of pure relligion the ſacrifice eyther in morning or euening vſed in old time: then <hi>Caiphas</hi> who wyth ſinfull hands, did celebrate moſt deteſtable and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſacrifices. More iuſtly maye you terme him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13981:84"/> which by the inſtinct of God, knoweth many things which are aboue mans capacitie, and knoweth the ready, and moſt certayne way to ſaluation, then <hi>Balaam,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded with deſire, ſaw not deſtruction for him prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Diuinely therefore was ſpoken that Godly ſaying of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he diſputed of the worthines of Chriſtian men. <hi>You are</hi> (quoth he) <hi>a choſen people, a Princely, or peerles Prieſthoode.</hi> See how he ioyneth wyth the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of a kinge, the authority of Prieſthoode. For hee by no meanes would haue thoſe auctorities ſeuered. For he cannot wyth a good conſcience exerciſe the function of a prieſt, who can neither iuſtly rule himſelfe, nor wyſely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne other. Neither he that Princelike maynteyneth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and vpright dealing, can want that honour that to a prieſte is properly belonginge. Not ſo truly, that hee which liueth vertuouſly can incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly adminiſter holy rightes. For wee ſhould ſo make a confuſion of all offices, and all degrees of authoritie ſhould be taken away, then the which thing nothing can be more peſtilente. But yet ſhall euery man be a prieſte, that is a follower of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, to vſe that kinde of holy right, which is to offer vp his owne body, a liuely ſacrifice, holy, and pleaſſnge God: and to offer vppe due honour and reuerence proceedinge from a ſincere and pure minde, and vnderſtanding. What then foloweth? <hi>A holy Nation, a conquering people, that you mighte ſhewe forth and preach vertues proceedinge from him, which oute of darcknes hath called you into a marueylous light.</hi> Nowe in that hee ſayth Holy, which was taken out of darckenes, and called forth into maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light, that is to the knowledge of deuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, it is the gifte of the Holy Ghoſte, wyth his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and vertue, inwardly illumininge oure mindes, and ſtirringe them vppe, and bringinge them to the chiefeſte thinges of all. And that this is the peculiar token of a
<pb facs="tcp:13981:85"/> heauenly gift, and concerneth the auctority of Prophecie, who ſeeth not? For the function of Prophecie is nothing els, but a declaration made by the holye Ghoſte of hidden ſecreces, the ſearchinge and finding out whereof is aboue the reache and Nature of man. Seing therefore many thinges that farre exceeded mans ſenſes, are broughte to light by God: do wee doubte, but that there is imprinted in our mindes a certayne excellente gift of prophecie, and a moſt certayne foretellinge of many thinges to come? For what els is fayth wherewyth wee are all ſealed, and whereon wee are all grounded, but an aſſured hope of thoſe thinges which wee truſte to obtayne, engrafte in our mindes by God himſelfe? So falleth it oute that by the inſtincte and ſecrete workinge of God himſelfe, wee promyſe oure ſelues thoſe thinges which farre exceede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cogitacion of man: which oute of doubte appertayneth to the office of prophecying. Therefore this name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is commended vnto vs by no baſe gifte, and aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, giuen thereunto by Almighty God, but by moſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente and honourable titles. For ſo it is ayded and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the holye ghoſte, that it hath ſufficiente ability to obtayne Princely iuriſdiction, to haue a moſte excellente Prieſthode, and to be lifted vppe by the vertue and power of a heauenly minde, to immortality.</p>
               <p>BVt now ſith we haue already ſpoken of the beginning and worthynes of ſo holy and ſo excellente a name: I muſt alſo in few woordes intreate of the antiquity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Not to that ende truly as thoughe it greatly auayled to the worthines of Chriſtian kinred, how many armes and cogniſaunces of our generation wee can accompte, or howe longe continuaunce of time it helde the poſſeſſion of gentilitie. For ſeinge that it fetcheth his beginninge,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13981:85"/> and taketh his firſte ofſpringe and Originall from God, it feareth not the enuious reporte of newe made, and late ſpronge Nobilitie. But leaſt wee ſhoulde ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not a fewe, who in this kinred were the verye chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſte, and whoſe excellent vertue was renowmed in many places, I thought it expediente to entreat alſo of them. For there is no cauſe why wee ſhoulde fette the firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grounde of this name from the Actes of <hi>Antioche,</hi> in which Cittie firſt (as it is mentioned in <hi>Luke</hi>) the name of Chriſtians grew to be common. For althoughe this name then firſt was commonlye receyued, yet in deede, longe before <hi>IESVS</hi> was conuerſaunte wyth vs in earth, the worthines and excellencie of this name was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amonge men. For Chriſtians are ſo called, eyther becauſe they folow the doctrine or gouernment of Chriſt: Or els this name proceeded from that heauenly motion and annoyntinge: Or as I rather ſuppoſe both theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges auayled to the firſte inuention of the name, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were wholy preſt to folow their maiſter Chriſt, as thoughe they were by othe bounde thereunto, and alſo were pertakers of the ſelfe ſame annoynting. For who is ſo madde that he dare out of this kinred, to thruſte oute <hi>Moſes?</hi> Who had rather take vppon him reproche and contumely of Chriſte, then to haue plentie of all Princely wealth and ſumptuouſnes? Who dare denie <hi>Iacob,</hi> who wyth greate deuotion worſhipped Chriſte on a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Or <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who as a Sacrifice offered vppe to God, was a ſhadow of Chriſtes his puniſhmente? Or <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> which behelde the daye of Chriſte, and by the ſighte thereof conceyued a great and wonderful pleaſure? Or to conclude, who will ſuppoſe <hi>Dauid</hi> to be raſed oute of this lineall deſcente of Chriſtian kinred? wyth whom the couenaunte of Chriſte to bee borne of his line, which was ſometime made wyth oure forefathers, after a moſt holy maner and faſhion was renewed. But what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:13981:86"/> of man was <hi>Dauid?</hi> Such a one as in the whole order of his life declared himſelfe to be a man excellently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed wyth all Chriſtian vertue. It were an infinite la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, if I ſhoulde go aboute to recite them all that were before the law, and vnder the lawe. This one thinge I ſay and affirme, which by euery mans teſtimony is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that there was neuer in any age anye man commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſingular godlines and vertue, but he which wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all his hart embraced Chriſt. Thoſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould do, the Prophetes ſtirred vp therunto by the holy ſpyrite fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde. Moſt holy kinges haue had their harts ſet on fire, wyth an earneſt longing and deſire after him. A figure of him many men furniſhed with all kinde of vertue by many ſignes, expreſſed and ſignifyed. And euen as when in a maner of a triumphe he was brought into <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an innumerable company and multitude of people, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of parte which went before with their garments ſtrowed the way, and parte that folowed after wyth a wonderfull clapping of hands, ſignifyed gratulation and harty reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge: yet one generall voyce of them all was heard, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth to the vttermoſt they could his vnuanquiſhable vertue. So thoſe worthyes of auncient time prepared the way vnto Chriſte, and their poſterity followed Chriſte, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a moſt ardent deſire: and by the general voyce of them all the prayſes of their onely King and Lord, are lifted vp as highe as heauen. This was that example which was propoſed to <hi>Moſes</hi> to followe. <hi>Beholde</hi> (ſayth God vnto him) <hi>and do according to the example vvhich in the hill is ſhewed vnto thee.</hi> And not onely to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but vnto al them in whom ſingular godlines &amp; deuine wyſedome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, who throughe Chriſte the onely refuge of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine affayres, haue obtayned all thoſe worthye indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and qualities of the minde, which made them in fame and reporte flouriſhe. Who, as they were by fayth

And ſo to paſſe ouer that, that they did not altogether lacke the ſight of him, For not ſo ſeldome as ones he offered himſelf to be ſeene of thoſe moſte holye men. As to <hi>Moſes</hi> both in manye places, and eſpecially in that fire and flame of the Buſh: As to <hi>Eſaie</hi> being placed in that Princely and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ſeate: As to many other whom to recken it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. That here therefore I ſhould not declare how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them behelde Chriſte couered vnder ſome certayne forme: that truly is moſt euidente that they all examined all their actions in their whole life accordinge to the rule of Chriſtian diſcipline. But when a man conſidereth with himſelfe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> humbly lifted vppe his handes vnto God, and beſeeched him to appeaſe his wrathe, and graunte mercie and pardon for thoſe that were then the ennemies of God, can any man doubt but that he confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his life to the commaundements of Almighty God?

If therefore it liketh vs that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhoulde therefore be called, becauſe they followe the

Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man then doubte to attribute vnto them the order and dignitie of true Chriſtians, who receyued the ſame gifte of the holy Ghoſt that we our ſelues did, and which ſuppoſed that all the meanes and procuremenses of their ſaluation reſted onely in Chriſte?

For he doth not with more earneſt endeuoure inſtructed vs to exerciſe the office and duety of any vertue whatſoeuer, nor more often bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into our heades, nor with more earneſt and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſpeaches beateth downe anye vice, then the foule vice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice and cruelty. So that when hee propoſeth before our eyes the ſeueritye of the laſt generall iudgement, and declareth who are to be choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and called into heauen: who agayne to be thruſt doune into the place appoynted for the wicked, and into vtter darcknes: hee rekoneth vppe no other duetyes, but thoſe that proceede out of curteſie, and liberalitye. Neyther powreth he out threates, namely agaynſt any, but cruel and vncurteous men: <hi>You did not</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>harboure me when I was a ſtraunger, you did not cloth me, when I was naked, you did not viſite mee when I was weake,</hi> and al the reſidew of lyke ſort. Which truely wee muſt not thinke ſo to be taken that through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues there is no acceſſe to glory and renoumne: or that other offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are not to be puniſhed with moſt ſharp &amp; bitter puniſhement. What is the cauſe then why he doth not recon vp other offences. Whither for that cauſe, that as there is no vertue whiche moore reſembleth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, then curteſie and liberality: ſo nothing more deteſtable, more odious, more repugnant to the pleaſure and wil of God, then the vice of auarice &amp; cuttethrote cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltye. Therefore when he had declared the order of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13981:91"/> laſte iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, no nede had he to recite all kynds of dutyes but thoſe he woulde onely contayne in his treatiſe whiche are ſimply the beſt in al our lyfe eſpecially to be practiſed. For nothinge can be donne in earth that is more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to belpe them that be in miſery, to geue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure to them that be aflicted, to ſhewe mercie to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be perplexed and diſmayed, with good turnes to healpe a greate numbre, to deſerue wel of al men in general, there is no more preſent remedy to cure all the maladyes of the mynd, there is no more expedite and ready way to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Al they therfore that are not only in name Chriſtians, but in life and conuerſation conforme themſelues to the rule and diſcipline of Chriſt, exerciſe eſpecially this one vertue and ſuppoſe that they oughte with continuall earneſtnes of deſire to imbrace the ſame, and in the ſame they thinke repoſed a great ſtrength, and pilloure of their ſaluation. Then thinke they themſelues to followe his rule and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, whiche made vs partakers of heauenly and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ritches: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they beſtow al their whole ſubſtance vppon the generall profit and commoditye of all men. Now conſider how greate the excellencie is, howe greate the honour and eſtimacion of Chriſtian liberality? the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſorte of men thinke that they haue gotten ſufficiente prayſe for their bountie and francke dealing yf they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie other men in that, wherwith they abounde out of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſure. And the moſt part of men doe into ſo narrowe a compaſſe and into ſuch ſtrayghtnes drawe the office and dutye of liberalitye, that they ſuppoſe they owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to anye bodye, but vnto theymſelues and vnto theym that by conſanguynytye and aliance are lincked vnto theim. And if they beſtowe good turnes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon other, they beſtow them vppon ſuche that are lyke, &amp; through the poſſeſſions able manfully to requite theym, &amp; more abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly then they haue at their handes receiued. But they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue wholy geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule &amp; diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyn
<pb facs="tcp:13981:92"/> of Chryſt, do not onely in aboundance of wealth, but alſo in aduerſitye and when they liue porelye performe al dutys to curteſie &amp; liberality appertayning. Further they thinke no man an alian whom they can by anye meanes healpe. Laſtly of al they are not ſo much diſpoſed to dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le franckly with them that are able to make them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent amendes, as wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who for their great neceſſitye, and want are not of abilitye to make requital of a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te receiued. Neyther are they of that nature and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition that they wil onely lay out their money and leaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good actes vndone, as geuing good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, and good example of vertue and applying to al good thinges their induſtrye and dilligente. But whatſoeuer with their witte, labour, ſtudye and payne can poſſibly be attayned, they will take in hand, ſo that they may do good to other men therby: neyther by venturinge their lyues will they at anye tyme ſticke to ſaue other men harmeleſſe and free frome daunger, eſpeciallye them that profeſſe the name of Chriſt. For ſo great agreement is there amonge them in the profeſſion of true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are inſtructed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of God: ſuche a fryendly league in all honeſt &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous accions, and to conclude ſuch a perfect and firme knott of loue and frendſhippe, that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of his owne eſtate then of the eſtate &amp; condicion of other men, It is not therfore to be maruayled that the number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſo great which to relieue other mens neceſſitye and want, haue ſpente all that their fathers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue left theym: ſeeynge that manye to do good vnto other men haue moſt manfully and couragiouſly loſt their liues. And what neede I in ſuche a numbre rekon a fewe? for in the firſte beginninge of the churche theeſe duetyes of loue and charitye were generally embraced, and now they are not of all men forſaken. For there are not a fewe which doe not onelye diſpyſe all ryches, and wordlye ſubſtance but alſo yf the caſe ſo required woulde be contented for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13981:92"/> other mennes ſakes to looſe their liues. For the cleare lighte of Chriſtian vertue and honeſtie hath alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Sometimes it hath bin more generall, and led verye manye into the righte waye. Sometimes it hath conducted but a fewe, yet alwayes hath bin well accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, and ſhall as longe as the worlde continueth, keepe his wonted honour and eſtimation. For it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of menne: but God himſelfe did therewithall eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe mannes mutable eſtate, and brittle condition. Therefore there will neuer wante ſome which will not more eſteeme of theyr owne priuate commodities, then of the ſafetie and preſeruation of all men. In ſo much that they will beſtowe wyth a righte good will theyr liues, ſo that thereby all men generallye maye reape ſome fruite, and commoditie. And this one thinge as each thinge els, deſerued greate admiration: That men beinge by Nature lincked in loue, yet it hath ſo fallen oute, that they beinge intangled wyth vices and troubleſome affections of the minde, verye ſeeldomlye haue applyed themſelues to the maintenaunce of perfect frendſhippe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo manye hundred yeares ſcarcelye two or three cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of frendes haue bin founde, that haue continued in a firme and ſtable league of frendſhippe. Of whom alſo wee haue notice rather by the fayned Fables of Poetes, and by a generall opinion conceyued of our elders, then a certayne proofe, by teſtimony of ſufficiente credite.</p>
               <p>But after that the mindes of men were able to beholde the exceedinge brightnes of his Heauenlye doctrine, ſo grrate conſente of loue was incontinently amonge men, ſo firmely were they vnited in prrfecte frendſhippe, that no manne would holde any thinge in ſeuerall, as his owne proper goods: but eche man beſtowed all his worldly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce to the vſe and commoditie of all menne in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. But whye do I ſaye worldly ſubſtaunce, ſeinge it
<pb facs="tcp:13981:93"/> is manifeſt that the goodwilles of all men were ſo lincked together, that no man thought good of any thinge, but all men did allowe thereof, no man deſiered anye thinge, but that, that was expediente and behoouefull for the ſaftye and good eſtate of all menne. Luke ſayth: <hi>One vvas the harte and minde, of the nomber of them that beleeued in GOD.</hi> Neyther did anye of them accompte that which hee poſſeſſed to be his owne: but they had all thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Here you ſee that woorthy and excellente kinde of frendſhippe, that throughe the opinion of Vertue is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: (a bare paterne whereof reſembled as it were in a ſhadowe in Poets Tales, ſtrake into menne a greate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: vnto the which ſcarcely two or three couples of men haue attayned) not embraced onelye of a fewe, but wonderfullye mayntayned of all the whole multitude of Chriſtian people. For ſo firmely were they in mindes vnited and ioyned, that they did not onelye liue after one manner, and vnder one lawe, but all generallye were of one minde and one will, and deſire. To conclude onelye in Chriſtians the perfection of true frendſhippe appeared, the cleare lighte of vnfayned loue ſhined. For euen as wee note in manye a certayne endeuour to be vertuous, but wee ſee in no man the perfection of Vertue, that hath not a taſte of Chriſtian relligion: ſo although many haue had the outwarde ſhew and appearaunce of frendſhippe, yet the liuelye and naturall ſhape of true frendeſhippe onelye in Chriſtians hath beene to bee founde. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that frendeſhippe ſpringeth oute of Vertue, it muſt of neceſſity folowe, that perfecte frendſhippe ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne onely in them, in whom perfecte Vertue is repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and putte. But let it in this Booke ſuffice of Iuſtice, liberalitie, and frendſhippe the fountayne of liberalitye in fewe woordes to haue intreated. The reſidewe of my diſcourſe, in which I muſt diſpute more at large of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13981:93"/> fortitude and magnanimitie, becauſe of the peeuiſh and peruerſe dealinge of them which cannot finde in theyr hartes to yelde vnto Chriſtian men the commendation of that Vertue, I will remitte, and put ouer to the proceſſe followinge.</p>

It remayneth therefore (<hi>Lewis</hi> moſte puiſſaunte Prince) that wee in more ample manner ſpeake of fortitude, and the vnconquerable courage of the minde, the worthines of which vertue is ſuch, that by no flouriſh of eloquence it may be ſufficienrly deſcribed. For they that haue not bin diſmaide at the terrour of death, they which haue wyth moſt valiaunte courage ſuffred bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely tormentes, they that would for no maner of griefe be diſturbed in minde, and do anye thinge to ſtayne theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, haue bin alwayes had in great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For whereas we all in generall thincke life to be ſweete, and do follow the intiſementes of Nature, whoe ſo deſpiſeth death, ouercommeth vndoubtedlye Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe. And truly how much admiration, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy renowne hath in all Nations bin attributed to this contempte of death: Hereby we maye haue an euidente token, that no vertue is in the bookes and monuments of learned men ſo muche commended, no vertue wyth like prayſe extolled. The iuſt and temperate men are after a meane ſorte commended, but ſtoute and valiaunte men are placed amonge the ſtarres themſelues. <hi>Socrates</hi> which was in his time the onely mirrour and example of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13981:94"/> and ſobrietie, purchaſed by no kinde of vertue ſo worthy fame, as by that his conſtancie which hee vſed in retayning his former dignity, when by the ſeuere ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Iudges he was condemned to die. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues which abydinge a very harde Fortune are throwen downe, being ſpoyled and bereaued of all their ſubſtance, and voyd of ſolace, if in extreme deſperation they do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to death, although in that kinde of death, there is a certayne ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of daſtardly cowardiſe (becauſe they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten their dyinge day not ſo muche for ſhewinge their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, as for auoydinge of myſerie) yet they themſelues which ſo of their owne voluntary diſpoſition depart from lyfe, are oftentimes wonderfully commended. For ſo muche is the vertue of the minde accompted of, that the counterfaite ſhewe therof ſtirreth vp admiration. Which if it ſo be, who can wyth words expreſſe the ſtoutenes and valiauntnes of Chriſtian vertue? For if the wittes of them that haue moſt profeſſed eloquence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would wyth trim ſpeaches, and rhetoricall woordes, deſcribe the prayſes of any humayne vertue, are ſometimes ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wyth the wayght of the matter, to what kinde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence can be ſo wonderfull, or ſo excellente, whereby a man may be able with filed phraſe and piked ſpeach, to ſet forth the worthines of ſo greate a vertue? But I albeit by reaſon of any witte or exerciſe am able litle to do, ſeing that I haue taken in hande ſo great a matter, leaſt grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhoulde be my blame in geeuinge ouer the ſame, then my boldnes in takinge it in hande, as farre forthe as my poore ability will ſerue, I will endeuour at large to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the excellencie of this ſo noble a vertue.</p>
               <p>ANd firſt wee ought to conſider what great diuerſitie there is betweene the fortitude nowe ſpecifyed, and
<pb facs="tcp:13981:95"/> mannes valiauntnes and magnanimitie.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all if you reſpecte the ende, they that for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſake venture theyr liues, obtayne the true ende of vertue: but they that propoſe vnto themſelues ritches or fame, and glorye, dependinge on the voyce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente of the vnlettered multitude, and reſpecte not the true ſoueraygne good, they are rather to bee accompted menne pufte vppe wyth a vayne deſire and ambition, then valiaunte and couragious men. Further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye offerre themſelues to daunger not wyth iudgemente, and prudente aduiſe, but beinge pricked forwarde wyth a certayne rage and furye of minde, conceyued eyther of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, enuie, or ſome other earneſte and whote affection.

Finallye they neuer take vppon the manye daungerous attempte, but beinge moued thereunto either with a verye earneſte hope, or with a deſperate feare of theyr preſent eſtate. For none of them except he had ſome certayne hope to eſcape daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or gaine ſome priuate commoditie, or els were paſte all hope of eſcapinge, woulde thincke it good to come into daunger: but oure men in many places haue beene ledde to theyr temporall bane, and death of the bodye, hauinge free election if they woulde, to liue in pleaſure: ſo that on one ſyde no hope of life was offered, on the other ſide, if they woulde forſake their opinion, they had propoſed vnto them manye thinges whereby they moughte liue a pleaſaunte life: yet notwithſtanding they marchinge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to a certayne and aſſured puniſhmente of moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell death, refuſed all pleaſaunte intiſementes of life, and neyther with threates, nor fayre promiſes coulde they be driuen from their profeſſion of faith, and Chriſtian pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13981:95"/> And againe of what force is that, that of ſo manye as are contayned in the memorie of manne, verye fewe haue beene founde which by learninge, exerciſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſtudy to do well, haue come to that perfection, that they with a willinge minde coulde ſuffer death: vppon a ſodaine there beganne to growe an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude not onelye of men and women, but alſo of children, and almoſt infantes, which haue for the fayth of Chriſte ſuffered ſtripes, death vppon Croſſes and Gibbets, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge fires, and to conclude moſte cruell kindes of death, with inuincible mindes and willinge hartes. When all the rulers of the worlde, and Lordes of the earth bent their maine force as it were, and ventured lyfe and limme to the intente all relligion and feare of God ſhould bee vtterlye rooted oute of the hartes of menne, when the Deuils themſelues, authours of all miſchiefe and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſtirred them to cruell tyrannie, whom they had with moſte vncleane, and filthye ſuperſtition as it were, ledde captiue vnder their auctoritie, when moſte ſtraunge and terrible tortures were deuiſed to the vtter ouerthrowe of Chriſtian diſcipline, when violence and horrible crueltye was practiſed in all corners of the worlde, where the faith of Chriſte was euer hearde of, when all theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were inuented to the ſubuerſion and ouerthrowe of Chriſtian Pietie: Notwythſtandinge ſuche was the vertue of true Nobilitie, and Chriſtian magnanimitye, that it did not onely with conſtante, perpetuall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible defence of Chriſtianity couragiouſly wythſtande the aſſaulte of the ennemyes: but alſo moſte willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and cheerefullye offered themſelues in Chriſtes quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to the ſworde, to fire, and faggotte. They were leadde awaye to execution, and cruell tortures: whippes, gallowſes, gibbettes, and tormentes neuer afore hearde of, were prepared for them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13981:96"/>
               <p>Neyther coulde thoſe butcherly bloudſuckers, growen through villanie into outragious fury, ſatiſfie theyr cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if ſtraight waye they ſhould haue bereaued of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues thoſe innocent Lambes, therefore wyth prolonginge theyr cruell puniſhmente they wente aboute to repreſſe that kinde of contumacie, ſpringing not out of preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pryde, but oute of rare and excellent vertue. Neyther were thoſe horrible cruelties practiſed for the loue they boare to theyr owne relligion, but onely for the enuye and mallice they boare to theyr excellente vertue, throughe which they ſawe all theyr thundring threates to be ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at, and vtterly deſpyſed. Yet theyr Chriſtian ſtoutnes could neyther be vanquiſhed, nor daunted, and diſmayde, nother wyth threates, nor wyth tortures, nor with anye neuer ſo exquiſite puniſhmentes. And when the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, yea the tormentes themſelues alſo beganne to ſlake their force, yet thoſe worthye wightes remayned ſtill in the ſame conſtancie and ſtoutenes of courage. But when againe, after a litle ſpace, theſe butchers returned wyth all cruel meanes to teare in ſonder the bodyes of Saincts, thoſe righte holye men came wyth a minde after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull maner confirmed, and newly imboldened to the ſame puniſhmentes. Neyther was there in the meane time any one word vttered of them, but that which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinglye ſet forth the laudes and prayſes of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſte. Therefore what more excellente and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy matter then this maye be in woordes contayned, or in minde conceyued? It ſeemeth to euery man a iuſte mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and occaſion of honour and glorye, to be paciente in the middeſte of tormente and perſecution: but theſe men did not onelye ſuffer death pacientlye, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wyth a glad and ioyfull harte did beare the croſſe of all kinde of trouble and affliction. For the aſſured hope of triumphe in Heauen, both diminiſhed and abated the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13981:96"/> bodily paine, and filled the minde which greate ioye and gladnes. A rare example of valiaunt courage is with praiſes euen to the ſky extolled. But in this race and kinred of Chriſtian people neyther the conſideration of age, nor the imbecillity of Sexe, nor of bloude, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, coulde bee anye lette or impedimente to this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye glorye and renoumne. For to what ende ſhoulde I make mention of thoſe whyche were the beſt and chiefeſt in any kinred: whereas children, and virgines innumerable haue refuſed for <hi>Chriſtes</hi> ſake no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of cruelty whatſoeuer. Howe many bondemen that they might preſerue and maintaine the free liberty of the minde, haue ſet at naught the bitter paines of moſte ſharp puniſhmentes? Howe many ſouldiars (which kinde of people moſt commonly abhorreth altogether the ſtudye of vertue, and ſanctimony) haue more eſteemed of death referred to <hi>Chriſte</hi> his laude and praiſe, then all maner of garlandes &amp; triumphes? What ſhould I recount the <hi>Mauricians, Sebaſtians, Catherines, Agathes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians:</hi> whereas it doth ſufficiently appeare that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them hath bene innumerable and all moſt infinit, that haue attayned the praiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellente vertue: the externall ſhewe and image whereof men indued with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wits, haue after longe exerciſe ſcarcely obtayned. All which may be to vs a ſufficient argumente and token, that this kinde of fortitude and confidente courage farre differeth from that, which is in the rules and monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of ethnike Philoſophers contained: which was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the mindes of Chriſtians, not by ſecular learning, but by the gracious gifte and goodnes of God: beinge the worthieſt of Chriſtian name and nobilitye, and the moſte certaine and aſſured teſtimony of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> moſt pure, and holy religion. Notwithſtandinge ſome there are who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre before our men in vertue, and valiant courage I ſay not ſuch as <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> were, whome ſome honoure
<pb facs="tcp:13981:97"/> as Gods immortall, but <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> who in his rage caſt himſelfe downe hedlonge from a high tower, or <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>docles</hi> who furriouſly raginge with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like madnes threwe himfelfe into the flaminge fire of <hi>Etna,</hi> or ſome other foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe and deſperate perſon. Therefore our men to wit, <hi>Cornelius, Cipriane, Laurence, Steuen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paule</hi> himſelf beinge moſt holy men, and excellinge in all vertue, are by no meanes rekoned of them in the numbre of ſtoute and valiaunt men. Further a certaine malepert, ſaucye, and wicked writer in bookes in which he hath contayned the hiſtory of his owne Citty, and many queſtions pertaininge to the ſtate of a commonwealth, in the <hi>Hetruſcan</hi> tongue thought not good to diſſemble what his opinion was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the religion of our ſacred and holy profeſſion. For he reporteth that the faith of <hi>Chriſte</hi> and his holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath vtterly deſtroyed the prowes and valiauntnes which was wont to appeare in men of oulde time. And therefore he imputeth the fall of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire, the decay of fame and glory, the ouerthrowe of chiualrye, to this moſt pure and holy religion of the moſt highe and euerlaſtinge God. Then afterwardes onely to currye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Godly, he affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great decay of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity came to paſſe not through the deprauatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion, but through the defalte of interpretoures, miſconſtringe and euell vnderſtandinge the ſame: whereas notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge he is not able to ſhewe what crooked ſence of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation that was, that miniſtred matter of ſo great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. But that leauinge behinde him the ſtinge of hys mallice, he mough ſeeke ſome ſhifte to eſcape by meanes whatſoeuer, hee ſalueth a greife moſte iuſtly conceyued, with that remedy and medicine moſt fooliſhly applied. I would willingely haue ſome compaſſion ouer him, for that he is deade, yf he did not nowe corrupte manye more with his vile and peſtilent writinge, then in time paſt with his leud life moſt reprochfull and ſubiecte to to contempt.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13981:97"/> But for as mutch as his bookes though he be deade, do ſo greatly ſclaunder Chriſtian nobility, I will not doubte, beinge (as I truſte) defended and protected with the ayde and aſſiſtance of <hi>Chriſte</hi> to combate with the ſpirite and ghoſte of this wicked perſon. Whych notwithſtandinge I do not for the deſire I haue to encounter with another, but onely to withſtande their brainſicke and wicked dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, whoſe mindes are alike duſked with errour and blindnes. For this miſchiefe is ſpreade farre and wide, and hath greately infected manye with peſtilente contagion.</p>
               <p>THys therefore firſte would I demaunde of him, what he noteth in Chriſtians, that he may by anye meanes deeme worthy of contempte? For if ſo that it argueth a valiaunt and noble minde to cotemne the pompe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of worldly pleaſure, beinge lifted vp in ſuch maner, that it thinketh of nothinge, but that which is both heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and excellent: then truely nothinge maye make more for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour &amp; aduauncement of Chriſtians, who hauinge full knoweledge and vnderſtandinge that they are of the felowſhippe and companye of heauenlye wightes, dooe iudge no worldely and tranſitory thinge worthy of eſtima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, imployinge al their trauaile and labour to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge true honour, and immortality. If fortitude be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companed with inuincible patience, who would not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the courage of Chriſtians, when he ſhall conſider that virgines themſelues, for the name of Chriſte haue deſired moſte cruell puniſhmentes, and all maner of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylye tormentes.</p>
               <p>howe hyghelye was <hi>Leaena</hi> the Harlotte commended, whyche beynge rente and torne wyth manye tormenes would not detecte them that were pryuy to a certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy? What praiſe won <hi>Anaxarchꝰ</hi> for the like matter?
<pb facs="tcp:13981:98"/> How greatly was <hi>Thraſo</hi> of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for that hee would not be forced wyth any kinde of puniſhmente to procure the death of them that were partakers of one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie? Theſe men vndoubtedly <hi>Matchiauele</hi> himſelf (for ſo this notable wryter is called wyth whom I haue to deale) may not deeme in any wyſe worthy of contempt, becauſe they had no knowledge of true relligion, which he in no wyſe woulde haue to be magnifyed: and were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge partakers of trayterous attemptes, the meanes of deſcryinge whereof hee ſuppoſeth worthye of great commendation. But how obſcure is their conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie if it be compared with the valiaunt courage and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie of Chriſtian men? For if you reſpecte the cauſe, they for hate of the tyraunts by whom they were annoyed paciently endured theyr cruell puniſhments: our men for the loue of Chriſte, of whom they had receyued wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full benefits, thought all tormentes eaſye and tollerable. If you weighe the exceedinge greatnes of the tormente, &amp; the continuance thereof, you ſhall finde them not common and vſuall as theyrs were, but new and ſtraunge tortures were deuiſed for Chriſtians, which as longe as might be, moughte teare their liue bodies, and wonderfully beate and bruſe them. Furthermore, they when they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to extreeme miſerye, and ſtate of deſperation, ſeemed outwardlye to beare an externall ſhewe of their former worthines, and hauty minde: Chriſtians when they had free election to accepte that they beſt liked of, yet not with vnwilling minds they exchaunged a glorious and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death, wyth a lyfe ſtayned wyth ignomye, and ſhame. If you regarde the nomber, it is a ridiculous thing to ſet an infinite nomber, againſt a very fewe. Doſt thou then deſpyſe this holſome diſcipline, oute of which hath bin yelded ſo manye notable, and worthy examples of vertue? Canſt thou conſtantly affirme, that the mindes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13981:98"/> of men are induced to thinke beaſtly and abiectly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by this doctryne, which hath with ſtoutnes, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde mannes creditte, armed the tender nature of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the feeble age of childred: whiche hath ſtirren vppe ſo great a multitude to an erneſt deſire of prayſe and glorye? What peruerſe &amp; ouerthwart perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mind is this? that thou ſhouldeſt haue in admiration the vayn ſhadow of vertue, and ſhouldeſt ſuppoſe true vertue worthy of no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation at all. But no doubte herehence procedeth this great erroure. Thou doſte beholde onely the externall forme of the Croſſe of afliction, that excellente vertue that vnder the forme of the croſſe lieth hidden, thou doſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde. For the dull capacity of a ſimple vnderſtandinge ouerwhelmed wyth darknes, and with filth defiled, is not able to abyde the bryghtenes of ſo cleare a lighte. For the doctryne of Chryſte (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaythe) <hi>ſeemeth to wicked and deſperate perſons to haue a ſhew of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and to muche humilitye: But to them that are of a milde ſpirite, and confirmed with the grace of God, it ſheweth a fullnes of heauenly wiſedome, and moſt excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> For euen as in the perſonne of Chryſt all men bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde that face wherin as it was by the propheſie of <hi>Eſaie</hi> foretolde, there was no forced bewtye, nor ſemelines, and yet all men ſawe not the glory of that diuine nature which <hi>Iohn</hi> beheld, euen ſo manie through the lyke blyndes and wante of vnderſtandinge contemne the lyfe of Chriſtians voide of al wordlye pompe and are by no means able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the excellent brightnes of Chriſtian nobility.</p>
               <p>BVt as concerning the Romain Empyre (that we may ſay ſome thinge thereof, albeit it ſemeth a thing far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our intent and purpoſe) hath not this fine fellow which is ſo expert in all matters of pollecie, reade in moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wryters, that euen Cities themſelues haue their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

All thynges as they haue a beegynnynge ſoe neceſſarye it ys that they ſhoulde ones decay, and through the cruelty of death diſpatchinge eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye thynge periſhe and come to nothinge.

Wherefore it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth oute that no wyſe man doth wonder at the vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions and deſtruttions of common wealthes: and on the contrary part they thinke nothing ſo worthy admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a City eſtabliſhed &amp; indued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great principallityes. And therfore they ſuppoſe the queſtion is rather to be aſked why <hi>Sparta</hi> ſo many yeares continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſelfe ſame maner of gouernmente, and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame order of diſciplyne, then why the glorye and wealth of the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſo ſoone decayed. And this alſo is ſoe much the more wonderful in the <hi>Romaines</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13981:99"/> by howe mutch more this Cittye excelled all other that euer were in worthines both of glory, and dominion. For many thinges eaſelye beare vp themſelues: but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thinges by their owne peyſe &amp; waight, are come in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and fall doune to the grounde. Therefore wheras this fareth it with all Cityes and countryes, that no wyſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wondereth at their fall, but thinketh the cauſe of their longe continuance with greate ſtudie to bee conſidered of as a thing very incredible, This man well ſkilled, as he himſelfe thinketh in ciuill pollicie, lamenteth the decaye and ruinous fall of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as thoughe it ſhoulde haue beene perpetuall, excepte it had beene hindered by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chryſte, hee argueth of cryme the ſonne of God himſelfe. O thou man in madnes exceedinge all other. doſt thou aſke what other thing hath decayed the welth of the Romayne Empyre? Firſt I anſwere that as that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye was happely erected then grue to a more parfecte ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and by noble actes, floriſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confirmed with lawes, and ordinaunces, came to a perfecte rypenes of Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and was wonderfully aduaunced: ſo was it neceſſary that it now yeelding to ſtooping olde age ſhould at the length haue (as it weere) a laſte daye to liue in and ſhoulde feele the heauy ſtrok of the hand of death. Furthermore this I affirme that all thoſe good meanes by the which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre was firſt eſtabliſhed, &amp; by the which it moughte haue beene mayntained in the ſame eſtate, long before the birth of Chryſte was loſt and oute of their handes. Canſte thou in any wyſe thinke that when immoderate delicacy and riotte, when vnſatiable deſire of riches had ones by inuaſion entered into the manners of the <hi>Romaynes,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no accoumpte at al was made of the aucthority of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Senate: when the myndes of the raſkall multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by the ſediciouſe and branſicke orations of certayne deſperate perſons were tickled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hoope of rauine &amp; ſpoyle with violence and force to bereue the wealthyer ſort, of

Adde thereunto (if it like you) Saleable Elections, Iudgementes raunſomed, mattes of Prouinces, extraordinarye and infinite auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rityes, the chardge of the commonwealth committed to certayn men caried forth headlonge with a haſtye deſire of rule and principality, you may vnderſtand, that it could no otherwyſe be, but that the wealthe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> City vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cayed, it muſt nedes come to ruin. What ſhould I in this place declare the bloudy broyls in the times of <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Marius?</hi> whiche infinitelye plagued and vexed the Citye and with al manner of cruelty diſmembred the ſame, and at lenghth by the infection of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen to poſterytie continued, layd open a gap to the gouerment of Tyrautes. Doeſt thou then doubte but that the Citye beyng gaſhed and mangled with ſo many woundes, ſhould at the laſt be couered with moulde, the Cityzens with ſalte and bitter teares waylinge and lamentinge at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> funeralles thereof. And therefore if it be demaunded of wyſe men what time <hi>Roome</hi> fell to vtter decay they wil aunſweere (I ſuppoſe) that euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time wherin the old order of diſcipine and gouernment was aboliſhed, that common wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be of no reputation. For they linger no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the conſideration of the euent of any thinge, which moſt certaynly gather the thinges that folow after by the cauſes that goe before. If you aſke them that lacke wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and experience they wil ſtraight way elleadge that tyrannicall gouernment of <hi>Cesar.</hi> For there is no man
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13981:100"/> ſo beſydes himſelf that will thinke after the vtter aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of lawes, the loſſe of liberty, and the ouertourninge of the whole ſtate of pollicy, that any one ſparke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde common wealth remaineth. But I pray thee what toye tooke thee in the head that thou diddeſt impute the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of that Empire to the manners of Chriſtians? whereas not only the cauſe of that calamity, but the euent it ſelfe was many yeares before the birth of <hi>Chriſte</hi> oure Kynge? And if any man aſke the queſtion after tirannye had the vpper hande what waſted the wealth of <hi>Roome,</hi> taken from the whole Citty, and beſtowed vpon one man, firſt I will repeate thoſe thinges that I before rehearſed; that all thoſe worthye qualities whereby the people of <hi>Roome</hi> obtained their auncient renoume, and large Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, a great while began to decline, at laſt fell hedlonge downe to the grounde. For then immediatly in ſteede of frugality, outragious riotte, in ſteede of enduringe hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in warre, an excedinge tendernes and nicenes both of the whole body and minde: in ſteede of dreade, and awe of the lawes, impudent boldnes, vnſatiable luſte, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deſire, vehemently aſſaulted the myndes of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines:</hi> and ſtirred vppe men that bare goodwill to their country to vprores, and ciuill broyles. Further this I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the barbarous demeanour of their <hi>Emperours,</hi> and their ouerthwarte nature, ioygned with immoderate ryot, and vnbridled luſt, did as it were cut them of from al their proſperity. Neyther is there cauſe why I ſhoulde here recite ſo greuous plagues as wherewith the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was afflicted, ſeinge that it is euidently knowen that many for their cruelty, and horrible factes haue bene ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes of them that enuied them their place, and high auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But when the cuſtome of killinge of Rulers grewe to be familiar, and there was not onely counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waites and treachery deuiſed againſt wicked tyrantes, but
<pb facs="tcp:13981:101"/> againſt diſcreet, and moderate gouernours, and that the name of rule and Empire wanted due reuerence, at length the matter grewe to that paſſe, that nothinge was ſo vily reputed of as the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the ende when the aucthority of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and people of <hi>Rome</hi> was extinguiſhed, and the knowleadge of Souldiarfare together with auarice exceſſiuely increaſed, it fell oute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiars for a booty in ready money to be paide, did aſſign afore hand to whome they liſted the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Crowne. Therefore whereas they had reſpect neither to vertue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to nobility, but as it were makinge a bargaine of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; ſale vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> promiſed moſt, ſold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire, euery vile caitife &amp; leude varlet had free acceſſe to the ſwaye and gouernmente of the whole common wealth. Therefore whereas the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were gouerned by ſutch heades, it coulde not be but all thoſe thinges ſhoulde fal to vtter confuſion, whereby that common wealth was wont to be renoumed. Eſpecially ſeinge that oftentimes, leaſt there ſhoulde want at any time an occaſion of ciuill diſſention, there was appoyncted in diuerſe places, many <hi>Emperours,</hi> if they were to be called <hi>Emperours,</hi> and not rather ſtraunge and prodigious monſters. Therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wealth of the <hi>Romaines</hi> partly by ciuill diſcord, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible diſſentions waſted, partely dronke vppe and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the meanes of great and terrible warres, which throughout the whole worlde was waged againſte the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire, was ſubiecte to common thraldome &amp; miſery, of all thinges incident and appertaininge to man. And here (I pray thee) what cauſe haſt thou to accuſe the name of any thinge that is called Chriſtian? For if the doctrine of <hi>Chriſte</hi> had wrought in the manners of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> contempte of lawes, ryot, wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deſire of rule, moſt egre and vehement diſſenſion of Cittizens amonge themſelues, if to conclude, it had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to violente dealinge, fury, &amp; rage: then mough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13981:101"/> thou haue iuſtly and truely ſayd that, that had bredde in the ſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> all theſe miſchieues. For they be thoſe horrible vices, that haue plagued and deſtroyed not onely <hi>Rome,</hi> but all other <hi>Imperiall</hi> Citties. But if nothinge be more repugnant to Chriſtian maners, and conuerſation then the vyces afore reherſed, wyth whome nothinge agreeth, but that whych is iuſte, and vpryghte, tendinge to quietnes and temperaunce: which moſt reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently accoumpte of modeſty, and innocency, and aboue all miſchiues hate ciuill diſcord: which abhorre all trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and deſperat enterprices, yet wilt thou be ſo ſottiſh &amp; impudent, that thou wilt ſeeke with this ſclaunder to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the dignity and worthines of Chriſtianity? Can there any maner of diſcipline more confirme and eſtabliſhe cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill pollicie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which teacheth Iuſtice, equity, méek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, loue of our country, and conſtant affection of vertue? And all theſe thinges truely in the maners of Chriſtians are founde in degree of moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perfection. I could recite howe many Chriſtian <hi>Emperours</hi> there haue bene by whom the Empire impayred and fallinge to decaye, hath after innumerable calamities beene reared vppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and reſtored to his former eſtate and dignitye. I could ſhewe that the borders thereof haue bene more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply enlarged then euer they were before, by the moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt maynteynours of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> religion. To conclude, I could by force of reaſon conſtraine them to graunt that thoſe miſeries which afterwardes lighted vppon them, happened not throughe the loue, but throughe the contempte of Relygion. But beecauſe I make haſte to the ende, this one thinge will I ſaye, that death purſueth not onely al men, but alſo al humayne artes and ſciences, all nations, and eſtates of gouerment: and they al at laſt fade awaie, and are ouerwhelmed with the loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome darkenes of ſloggiſhe obliuion. Onelye it is the kingedome of <hi>Chriſte,</hi> which can by no force of enemies
<pb facs="tcp:13981:102"/> be ouerthrowen, by no worldly wealth ouerborne, by no ciuill broyles and diſſenſions at any time torne, and rent in ſunder. The ritches of the <hi>Perſians</hi> are cleane conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the mighty powre of the <hi>Grecians</hi> is vtterlye ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the Empire of the <hi>Romaines</hi> is beaten downe, &amp; hath had a great fall. All thinges that eyther are, haue bene, or hereafter ſhall haue beinge, after one ſorte or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall periſhe and come to nothinge at the length: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingedom of <hi>Chriſte</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all goodly orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts enritched, worlde without ende ſhall floriſhe, and ſhall abound with immortall and euerlaſtinge glorye: by ſacred Oracles it hath bene foretolde, <hi>the powre, of him is an euerlaſtinge powre, which neuer ſhall be taken away, and his Kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it is that ſhall neuer be diſperſed.</hi> And in an other place, <hi>It hath pleaſed mee therfore to ſhewe forth ſignes of him, becauſe they are great, and his meruailous things becauſe they are ſtronge, and his kingedome, becauſe it is euerlaſtinge.</hi> And that ſayinge alſo. <hi>Thy kingedome is a kingdome of all worldes, and thy rule from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to generation.</hi> Alſo that which is recorded in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of the kinges, is to be vnderſtoode of this kingedome. For in this manner God talketh with <hi>Dauid.

Let them at the length vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of <hi>Chriſte</hi> is ſuch, as no age or time can extin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guiſhe: to wit, whoſe glorye, praiſe, vertue, worthines, ritches, power, are immortall, &amp; heauenly. And whereas all other thinges are fraile, and brittle, they haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13981:102"/> and appoyncted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſhorte race of life to ronne. Onely therfore the names of Chriſtians leaninge and reſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting vpon the ſtayes and proppes of the aide and aſſiſtance of God ſhall floriſh for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>IT foloweth that wee ſaye ſomethinge of fortitude and chiualry, the practiſe &amp; vſe wherof he demeth to be vnſit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting &amp; far vnfit for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profeſſion &amp; conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For how agreeth (ſayeth he the contempt of glory, which is wont to be preſcrybed to Chriſtians, with the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this vertue. For no man excepte hee be ſtirred vp with the deſire of renomne, wil thinke good to take vppon hym any ſtraunge and daungerous aduentures. Nowe whereas he affirmeth that no man can be valiaunt except he be induced thereunto throughe the deſire of fame and glory, I do not doubt that thoſe Philoſophers will eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graunte that, whiche haue both written bookes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of glory, and haue deliuered vnto vs manye rules &amp; principles of prowes and valiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For if they had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that of thoſe thynges, one had deſtroyed the other, they would neuer haue bene ſo mad, that by the ſelfeſame reaſons, and meanes, men might bee diſſwaded from the deſire of glorye, and incited to the ſtudye, and loue of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? And they defined vertu to be that, which did not depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on the vayne brute and reporte of the people, but whiche tooke in hande great and noble enterpryces onelye for the loue of honeſty. But this iolly fellow ſo argueth, as if the onely deſire of prayſe ſhoulde pricke men forwarde to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and there were not muche better prouocations of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and induſtrye, with which good mens myndes, night and day vrged and allured, tooke vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daungerous attemptes, both with a right goodwil, and with great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and payne. As the entyre loue of oure countrye, the greate care of our honour, and eſtimation, a reuerent due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
<pb facs="tcp:13981:103"/> both towardes the lawes, and alſo toward religion it ſelfe. All whiche thinges are moſt perfectly contayned in the rules &amp; inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtians. What if they be moſt deſirous of prayſe? yet will any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be either ſo mad or impudente, that for this cauſe hee will ſeeke to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyte them, and ſtayn theyre honoure. They are trulye far of from the deſire of vayne prayſe, yet wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the deſire of immortall and true glorye.</p>
               <p>They ſette at nought the report of men, yet they are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly bent to true prayſe, which is contayned in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt, beholding al things. They deſire not to haue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beholders of their matters, for aſmuch as they knowe when they attempte any worthy actes, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells of heauen loke vpon them. This is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of a noble mynd, of a gentlemanlyke and haughty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage not to hang vpon the opinion of the ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to neglect all thinges here below and to viewe and contemplate thynges heauenlye and ſpyrituall. For what he calleth abiect and baſe I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not wel perceiue. For if he thinke that pryde and inſolencie, cruel and brutiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, myndes loftye and diſdaynfull, and maruailouſly puft vp, argueth a noble and valiaunt courage: then grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I that there is nothing more vile and abiecte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtock and generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtians, which doth forſoth with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeuoure watchfully apply the ſtudy of temperance, mildnes and lenitie. But if al vertues as the beſt learned men haue teſtified, and declared, are conteined in one linck of loue, ſociety, and coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither can there be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any repugnance, ſo far of is it, that the prayſe of mild<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and modeſty ſhoulde be oppoſite and contrary to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye courage that by no meanes they maye bee diſlinked, &amp; feuered. Therefore no man can be valiante excepte he bee both mylde and moderate. For he is muche deceiued in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynion which thinketh the force of the mynd ſtirred vppe not with deſire of Equitye, and humanity, but with whote
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13981:103"/> deſire and furious rage is rather to bee called ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hode the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cruel egrenes of a ſauage beaſt. But this notable authour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inſtructeth Princes how to vndoe their countrye which teacheth them to eſtabliſhe the wealth and eſtate of theire kingdomes not ſo much by equity, and curteſie, as by guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pollice and crueltye: let him truelye call by what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me hee will that furious dealinge farre paſſing the vſage of the barbarians themſelues in villany, and tyranny, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man in his right wittes will aſſent to ſo fonde and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked an opynion. But wee will neuer be ſo woode and frentick, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we wil ſay that, that meknes of mynd which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture calleth humility, whereof he was an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was alſo a paterne of notable prowes, is any impediment to fortitude it ſelfe. For whereas all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are as it were with glue faſtned together: then truly eſpecially meeknes of mynde and valiaunt courage.</p>
               <p>For eache of them proceeding out of a noble mynd are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of like honour and eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for it is no greater ſigne of a valiaunt courage to be able to withſtande the force of his enemyes, then to refrayne his angry mode: &amp; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due al troubleſome affections, and by no grudge of offence to bee remoued from humanity and conſtancie of mynde. Therfore there hath not beene any man lightlye famous for valiantnes, but he hath purchaſed prayſe by mildnes and curteſie. How greate was the glory of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> who ſittinge in counſell with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> was of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captaynes contrary to order of ciuilitye bitterly tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? but he thoughte good not to reſtrayne theire lauiſhe ſpeaches with yelding tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but wiſely to appeaſe them with patience and ſufferance. What ſhoulde I ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake here of <hi>Pericles?</hi> what ſhoulde I reherſe <hi>Iulius Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and many other, who did no more earneſtlye ſeeke to get them a name by martiall proweſſe, then to win com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation by curteſie and pacience. On the other ſide as eache ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of a more ſhrinking and daſtardly courage,
<pb facs="tcp:13981:104"/> ſo is he moore diſpoſed to anger and crueltye. All thoſe barbarians whiche can by no meanes be trayned vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preceptes of fortitude haue bene counted ſo cruel that our vſuall ſpeach hath aſcrybed the name of barbarouſnes to cruellty it ſelfe. What ſhoulde I ſhew you here of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature and qualityes of women? then whom, as nothing is more feble and weake, ſo nothinge more ſwyftlye cari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to reuengement of iniurye? For if mildnes and curteſi-do not at al dimme the lighte and exceedinge brightnes of vertu, but iſſuing oute of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyke haughtines &amp; generoſitie of mind, is a great orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to fortitude: is ther any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo voyde of reaſon, that Chriſtian mildnes he will terme co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe, repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and oppoſite to the rules of fortitude? what peruerſe dealinge? what an vngodly moode (a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and ſorowe come to it) is this? that wee make light accompt of thoſe thinges that are true and perfect in our men, the bare ſhadowe whereof in other men wee haue in admiration? they haue alwayes bene counted of a noble and valiaunt courage, who beeyng girded and nipped w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; prouoked with iniury are not ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled with wrath. But our men, of Chriſt haue learned this leſſon, that they ſhoulde requite with curteſie reprochfull wordes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury with good turnes. Then ſome man may ſaye vnto me: wheras chriſtians are ſo gentle and merciful, they wil neuer dryue backe from their bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the force of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, neyther wil reſiſte villanye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> duety of ſworde, but they wil with a good turn requit al outragious dealing. Who ſo alledgeth this, litle conſidereth diſtinctions of du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyes, neyther conſidereth that diſtinct and diuers thinges are mete &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for deſtinet &amp; diuers perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, places, ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes, &amp; cauſes. For Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues who in priuate grudges &amp; iniuries embrace mildnes &amp; patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyſtreſſes &amp; dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers are moſt egre of al &amp; are moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſte and vehemente maynteiners of the common ſafetye
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13981:104"/> and liberty. Eſpecially whereas the ſtate of religion is impugned. For they thinke in this caſe all ſufferance an intollerable offence, and patience to be a horrible faulte. Of this minde was <hi>Moyſes</hi> the beloued of God, whom the holye ſcriptures do teſtifie and declare of all men to haue bene the myldeſt, who notwythſtandinge with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular valiaunce vanquiſhed the hoſt of his enemies, and appeaſed the wrath of the maieſtye of God offended, with the ſharp puniſhmente of many. <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo was of like nature whom about other the ſcriptures do highely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend for his exceedinge gentlenes. He neuertheleſſe va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed and put to flight a great and puiſſaunt hoſt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and put to the ſworde huge multytudes of Alienes and ſtraungers. Euen ſo, manye Chriſtian Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge moſt dyſpoſed to all kinde of humanitye, haue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the glory of Martiall proweſſe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and courteſie. What? Hath not <hi>Chriſte</hi> himſelfe ſufficiently taught vs by his owne example, howe farre foorth wee ſhould vſe lenity, and againe when wee ought to take vppon vs the perſon of ſeuerity, when with whips he ſeuerely and ſharpely puniſhed them that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittinge ſacriledge, polluted the holy Ceremonies? Therefore there is no cauſe why any man ſhould contemne Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an meekenes, wheras it is ſo ioygned with true fortitude, that nothinge can be more firmely and ſurely tyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For they both iſſue and flowe from one headſpringe and fountaine, and the one wonderfully beautyfieth and adourneth the other.</p>
               <p>NOwe let vs come vnto the laſt argument of this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble writer, wholy conſiſtinge in religion, and in thoſe olde Ceremonyes wyth all wickednes polluted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For he thinketh that bloudy ſacrifice, and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of beaſtes, to haue ſutch force, and efficacy, that was
<pb facs="tcp:13981:105"/> able vppon a ſodaine of timerouſe perſons to make fearce and hardy. And vs that neither vſe any ſuch bloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, nor imbrue our aulters with the bloude of fowre footed beaſtes, nor looke vpon the bowells and intralles of beaſtes, he ſuppoſeth by this inconuenience happening by the meanes of our religion, to be depriued of many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye meanes and furtheraunces to the attayninge of vertue. Here truely I knowe not what might be added eyther to the rage of his impietye, or to the blindnes, and folly of his minde: for to compare horrible ſuperſticion with the moſt holy religion of the euerlaſtinge God, it is an offence paſte all ſatiſfaction, and abhominably wicked: but to thinke him that can beholde with a countenaunce voyde of quakinge and tremblinge feare in the butcherly manglinge of beaſtes, like to proue a valiaunt man, it is a plaine argument of extreme madnes. For if wee ſhall followe his counſell, why do wée not muſter all the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers wée can get? Why do wée not alſo preſſe foorth to battaile hangemen, for they of force muſt be more cruell then other, which quarter and cut vp the bodies of men. That they forſooth with that Noble courage that they haue gotten by thruſtinge in their armes elbowe déepe in the bloude of beaſtes, and by ſharpe puniſhment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned perſons might deſperately venture amonge the thyckeſt of their enemies, and keepe vs ſafe &amp; harmeles from all imminent daunger. What if I ſhewe that all thinges contayned in thoſe ſacrifices and ceremonies dyd tende to timorouſnes and cowardiſe, nor that there was in them any thinge to imbolden the minde of man? Firſt thoſe prayers of theirs in olde tearmes and ſolempne woordes appoyncted to be ſayde, what a deale of trouble and feare did it containe? In which if they ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen any whit to ſtomble and ſtagger, if any thinge were vttered in woordes out of courſe, or with ſignes &amp; tokens of ſiniſter happe they thought all the Goddes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13981:105"/> of <hi>Rome</hi> would be incontinently angry and highlye diſpleaſed. Further what a great feare was caſt on thoſe men, intangled with that oulde wiues ſuperſticion, when each thinge in the ſacrifice did not fall out to their minds? When the intralles threatned vnto them ſome dreadfull and dolefull deſtruction? But when it ſo chaunced that they ſhould at one time offer vppe manye ſacrifices, and it happely ſo fell out, that the bowelles of one beaſt gaue thoſe ſignes whereby men ſuppoſed that the Goddes dyd promiſe that all thinges ſhould proſperouſly and well ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and the bowells of other, portended ſome dolefull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentes, it muſt needes bee that their mindes ſhould hange in doubte through wonderfull feare, which coulde neither be animated and encouraged wyth the intralls betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge good fortune, becauſe of their variety and inconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor againe deſpiſe thoſe that betokened ill lucke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that religion which they were ſo miſſeled in. What ſay you to ſtraunge ſightes monſters, the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwers of <hi>Birdgazers,</hi> and <hi>Southſayers,</hi> what greate force haue they to rebate and appaule the courage of men? When nothinge happened either by courſe of nature, or caſuall chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did not interpret to be done by the ſingular prouiſion of the Goddes, pretendinge ſome great plague, or calamity. Therefore either the flyinge of birdes, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blinge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Earth, or a thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derclap on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſide, or any other ſuch mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſterous matters &amp;, ſometimes prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious thinges fained, did wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully terrifie &amp; feare poore miſerable men. What ſhoulde I recite the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cinge of the Sunne? Which beinge forced, it woulde not ſuffer them that were ſuperſtitious and verye mutch geuen to halſoninge to conceiue any firme and aſſured hope at all. And if by anye chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce chickens happened to refuſe their foode, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter beinge once hard, ſonke into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mindes of the ſouldiers: they as thoughe forewarned of the Gods themſelues of ſome great ill that ſhoulde betide them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
<pb facs="tcp:13981:106"/> aſtonied, with that which they made ſo religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koninge of, and beinge troubled and dyſmaied with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feare encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred with their enemies. In many places therefore it is recorded that many hoſts haue bene put to wracke, &amp; ſlaine, becauſe with ill lucke, &amp; ill chiuinge they were conducted agaynſt their enemies. Which thinge truely is nothinge to be meruailed at. For they beinge wholy addicted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religion, to beleue that without the eſpecial prouiſion and powre of the Goddes, foreſhewinge ſome great ſcourge and plague, chicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s refuſed to eate of a ſoppe caſt amonge them, and for that all their courages began to quaile, and their handes through feare waxe chil for colde, and they themſelues did not with wonted hope and courage marche on to battaile, it muſt needes be that they ſhould haue ſome notable ouerthrow. And by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it was broughte about, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were wonderfully geuen to that kind of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom they tearmed fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, were troubled with continuall feare, and care of the minde that bredde continuall doubt. What, if many very valiaunt men moued with the leaſt and lighteſt ſtraunge ſightes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might happen in many places haue geuen great token &amp; ſigne of feare? The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpeake ſomewhat of the <hi>Grecians</hi>) when they tooke any warre in hande, and the Kinges accordinge to the maner dyd make ſacrifice in the vttermoſt boundes of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, if by any chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they were hindered that they coulde not accompliſh or finiſh their ſacrifice, they incontinently leadde their hoſts backe home againe. And whereas the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> obſeruinge the guiſe and facion of their countrey were trained vp to indure hardnes, &amp; to practiſe feates of armes, yet they became ſo daſtardly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means of their affiance in that filthy ſuperſticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſacrifices, that they at ſuch times woulde dimiſſe their ſouldiars.

For duringe the ſpace of a fewe dayes about that tyme, the light of the mone (as at certayne ſeaſons it muſt needs happen) was eclipſed by reaſon of the earth betwixt the mone and their ſightes. That <hi>Nicias</hi> thinkinge a rare and ſtraunge matter, thought good to deferre the ſame to the interpretors of ſecrete holye miſteries. They returned aunſweare, that it was not lawful within thirty dayes to ſcoure the ſeas with their nauie, or to take in hande any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great enterpryſe: In the mean tyme the men of <hi>Sycil</hi> with huge heps of earth dammed vp the mouth of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and placinge there many mighty ſhippes ſtopped vp their paſſage. Therefore that nauie of theirs, in which was contayned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flowre of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> youth of <hi>Athens,</hi> &amp; the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le force of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now in vayn they ſoughte to break through the nauie of their enemyes and endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to paſſe out of the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by that fond ſuperſticious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwation of <hi>Nicias</hi> was moſt miſerably ſcattered and beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doune and all the whole nobilitye had by dent of ſworde their bloudy bane and deſtruction.

For if the minds of men inſtructed with precepts of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion are thereby made cowardlye, and daſterdly, and by thoſe olde and vnclean ceremonies (in which God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye honoure was doone to the Idols of wicked men) they were incited to valiantnes, ſurely they ſeame to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the rules of our religion. But conſider with thy ſelf the fooliſh, madde, and erronious opinion thou haſt helde.

They are not troubled with earthquakes, with thunderclappes, with any prodigious and monſterous wonders. To conclude there is nothinge that can daunt or diſmay the mynde of a Chriſtian man.</p>
               <p>For he is ſo trayned that if hee ſhould ſe all the worlde egrelye bente to battayle, if hee ſhoulde ſee all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of daungers deuyſed and prepared agaynſte hym, if he ſhoulde ſee euerye thinge rounde aboute ſet on lighte fire and almoſt conſumed,, hee notwithſtandinge through an aſſured hope and confidence, ſhoulde remayne vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, neither be diſcouraged through the terrour of any miſchiefe. Firſt becauſe he beleeueth that he is garded and defended with a mightye and puiſſante armye. For he readeth in the holy ſcriptures that there are garriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13981:107"/> of Angells whiche defende the Godlye from all iniurye, and in tyme of neede qualifie the outrage &amp; force of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye. <hi>For Iacob knew him ſelfe with this ſtrength to bee fortified when he declared that he ſaw the tents of God.</hi> Agayne when the <hi>Syrians</hi> army was euen vppon <hi>Helizae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> readie to deuoure him, and his ſeruaunt ſtroken with great fear cryed for help: <hi>feare not</hi> (ſath,) <hi>Heliſeus, and be of good courage, for our number farre excedeth theirs.</hi> And it foloweth in that holye hiſtory. <hi>And when Heliſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us hadde made his prayers to god, hee ſayth O Lord open the eyes of this boye that hee may alſo ſee.

They beyng vanquiſhed weere ſlayne, but wee beeynge of good courage caried away the victory.</hi> This hope therefore (I ſay) will not ſuffer the familye of Chriſtians to be weake and fayntharted. Further the cogitation of immortalitye, and a certayne foreknowledge of glorye to come, what force hath it to the confirmation &amp; eſtabliſhing of their conſtancie? <hi>Caeſar</hi> reporteth that the Frenche
<pb facs="tcp:13981:108"/> men were maruaylouſly ſtirred vppe to all prowes and va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liauntnes throughe an opynion that the <hi>Druides</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be of, which was that the ſoules of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not ſubiect to death but after their departure paſſed from one bodye to another, and therefore caſtinge a part all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are of death, they valiauntly tooke in hande wayghty and daungerous enterpryces, not makinge accompte of lyfe. Whereas they were perſwaded that death was nothinge els but the chaung &amp; alteration of lyfe, and paſſinge of the ſoules from bodies to bodies. And is it euen ſo in deede? The auncient Frenche men through a moſte vayne opiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grounded vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a vile fond ſuperſtition, feared no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of daunger: and ſhall Chriſtians feare death, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not through a ſlender opynyon, but throughe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t truſt and affiaunce that after they haue departed this lyfe they ſhal obtayne moſt perfecte bleſſednes? For what is moore manifeſtlye knowen in Chriſtian religion, then that all they that embrace iuſtice and godlines, after that they are loſed out of their bodies, as it were oute of bonds ſhall as it were flye vp into heauen, that they mighte ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne worlde without ende euerlaſtinge glorye? Agayne what is more deepelye printed in oure myndes then that the bodyes whiche are nowe vtterlye conſumed, ſhal bee agayne reſtored, and beeynge wyth celeſtyall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye bryghtenes illumyned, ſhallbee agayne vnyted to the ſoules wyth ſo fyrme and ſure a league and band, that it can bee by no meanes vyolated and broken: that we beeynge after ſuche an heauenlye ſorte renewed mought enioy al perfect &amp; eternal pleaſurs both in bodye &amp; ſoule.

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:13981:108"/>
               <p>This vndoutedly is moſte euidente that our minds are by no meanes ſo muche incited and ſtirred vp to hazard &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture our liues, as by loue and charity. For to him that is in loue nothinge ſeemeth harde, and all thinges are moſte ſweete and pleaſaunte which are entepryſed for the attayninge that thinge which is vnto him moſte deare and tender. In ſo much that he not onely contemneth death, which ſeemeth to all men moſt terrible and dreadfull, but ſometimes perſwadeth himſelfe moſte willingly to deſire the ſame. That if loue lightly begonne betwixte man and man, and grounded on very ſmall cauſes hath ſuch force, that it cauſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contempt of death, what may be thought of the excellencie of charitie, which is through the gifte &amp; grace of the holy ſpirite moſte liberally powred into pure and vndefiled mindes? by the force thereof Chriſtian No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie ſuppoſeth all the ſweete pleaſure of life to be repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in labours and perils, deſpiſing all pleaſures of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, and the britle eſtate of honoures, and all aboundance of worldly wealth. And being greatly inflamed wyth the deſire of Chriſte, it cannot be remoued from Godlines, neither wyth threatninges, nor wyth terrours, nor wyth ſtraunge and newe deuiſed puniſhmentes. To conclude this loue maketh a man thincke that all tormentes which he ſuffreth for Chriſtes ſake, whom hee tenderly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly loueth, are lighte and pleaſaunt. Furthermore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge is ſo much deſiered and wiſhed for of Chriſtians as for the relligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the euerliuing God, to looſe theyr liues, in the middeſt of the moſt exquiſite tormentes of the body that can be deuiſed. Which truly is not to be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered at. For whereas loue turneth aſide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cogitacion of the minde from feare, it muſte needes be that perfecte and godly loue is armed wyth a wonderfull ſtoutenes and conſtancie of minde. Therefore which of theſe two relligions would ſooner allure men to the embracing of Vertue? doth that thincke you which holdeth the weake and frayle nature of
<pb facs="tcp:13981:109"/> of man alwayes in ſuſpence, through the vayne and foliſh credite they geue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle ſtringes that are in the intrals of beaſtes, to the flying of byrdes, to the hyuinge of Bees, and to ſuch other fained monſtrous deuiſes: or rather that religion which ſo eſtabliſheth and confirmeth the myndes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they would not be diſmayd if the whole world ſhould be turned vpſide doue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Further that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which with fond ſuperſtition ſometymes doth hinder the courſe of perfect exerciſe of humayne vertue? or that which with conſtancie proceedinge from vertue farre paſſing the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſtrengthneth the weake and ſoft nature of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the tender yeares of yong children? Finally is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be embraced which is not able to fortifi the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of men with any aſſured hope? or that rather, whiche ſheweth foorth the helpe &amp; aſſiſtance of God, with a moſte certayne hope of immortalitye, with an eſpeciall loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes almightye God, and with an earneſt and ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te deſire of him, who hath taught vs the perfection of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome and perfectly inſtructed vs to diſpiſe al world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye and tranſitorye vanityes. But what neede I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince with many argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impyetie or madnes of this moſt deteſtable &amp; vile caitife? wheras both of thoſe are ſo cleare and manifeſte, that nothinge is more eaſilye noted and eſpyed. His wicked impyetie appeareth in that hee woulde ſeeke in ſuche order to ſtayne the honoure of Chriſtians, whiche hee woulde neuer haue done, if hee had conceiued any good opynion of the Godhead of Chriſt His madnes appeareth in that he with ſo falſe, ſo fond, ſo ill codcluded reaſons confirmeth his wicked opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>But I knowe I haue longer ſtayed in this proceſſe, then per aduenture neede required. Which if anye man thinke worthy of blame, I would partlye he ſhoulde pardon my griefe wherewith agaynſte hym I was wonderfully ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And partlye that he ſhoulde thinke that that was not altogether impertinent to my purpoſe. For whereas I en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpryſed

                  </hi> writer in a moſt barbarous kinde of ſtile endeuoured to obſcure the ſame, I thoughte good not to diſſemble, eſpecially ſith that I perceyued the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of them which either ſtirred vppe by his wrytinges, or of theire voluntarye motion, were partakers of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and fury were, farre and wide diſperſed. Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas I haue refuted theyre broade and lauiſhe ſpeaches, and haue declared that whiche was cleare and manifeſte, that no daſtardlye feare and baſenes of abiecte myndes, but al thinges righte worthy and excellent were to be founde in the profeſſion of Chriſtians, and the whole order of this moſt holy diſciplyne did excit men to valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of courage, and contempte of death: yt was not beſide my purpoſe, makinge mention of fortitude that conſiſteth in martial affayres, to refute in few, their kynd of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which deteſt generally the noble knowledge of feats of armes, and all worthye chiualrye as a godleſſe &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing and quite repugnante to Chryſtes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Firſte therefore I can conceyue no reaſon why they ſhoulde deſpyſe warfare when it is ryghtfullye begon, and taken in hande in the defence of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wee ſee it wonderfully extolled in innumerable places of holy ſcripture. Which they do not denie, but what ſay they? manye thinges (ſay they) were conteined in the olde law which rather for the tymes ſake were tollerated, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy due commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As to make a diuorſe, to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vſury of forrayne countryes, of which ſort they ſaye is to make warre vpon our enemyes. But what ſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or ſimilitude hath either vſuoye, or diuorſes with martial affaires? For they were not commended, but tollerated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of mens weakenes and imbecillitye. But he that durſt preſume not to obey, when commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to wage battale, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted an offence ſo hainous, that he coulde redeeme the ſame by no ſatiſfaction.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13981:110"/>
               <p>For in what place reade wee that it was decreed that hee ſhould other abide a payne, or be ſubiecte to a curſe if anye man, whereas after the firſt offence his wyfe committed it was lawfull ſo to doe, did not depart from his wyfe, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted no vſurye of forrayners and ſtraungers? But in many places wee haue well noted, that men rauiſhed and repleniſhed wyth the holye ſpirite, haue decreed that they ſhould die the death which throughe cowardiſe refuſed to come forth into the fielde. But what ſhoulde I in this place make mention of <hi>Debora,</hi> who being inſpyred wyth the holye Ghoſte, curſeth them which for as muche as in them lyeth, take not in hand the warres of the Lorde: and inuegheth againſt their cowardiſe in ſharpe and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t words. Againe they lay to our charge circumciſion, the offering vp of a lambe, olde ſacrifices, which were in olde time with great deuocion kept, and after the comminge of Chriſte lackte their wonted reuerence. As though warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare did any whitte appertayne to the ceremonies and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteryes of holy thinges, and were not rather ordayned for the preſeruation of the common wealth? For thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rights, in which were foreſhadowed the expreſſe ſignes and tokens of Iuſtice and ſaluation to be procured by our highe and mighty ſauiour Chriſte, after the comming of the thing it ſelf which was by thoſe ſignes declared: were by good right and iuſt deſart abrogated and diſanulled. But this cannot bee thoughte of the noble knowledge of feates of armes, for as much as it is not compryſed vnder the nature of ceremonyes, but embraced for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and preſeruation of the common ſafetie, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertayneth to ciuill policie. And to confound thoſe thinges which are to be diſtinguiſhed, it is eyther the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of extreeme madnes, or an argument of wonderful temeritie, and raſhnes. And whereas the eſtate of the commonwealth cannot be eſtabliſhed, but it muſt needes be ſtayed, and as it were propped vppe wyth ſtrength and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13981:110"/> force of armes, for aſmuch as all thinges in time of peace to be practiſed and exerciſed, are vnder the tuition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of martiall proweſſe: he that taketh away the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of feates of armes, worketh the ouerthrowe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Which thinge if it had happened through Chriſtian diſcipline, then madde men moued wyth ſome reaſon, might lay to our charge that ſome commonwealth by meanes of Chriſtian diſcipline was ouerthrowen. Which ſlaunderous accuſation howe wicked and vaine it is we haue afore declared. For Chriſt would not that the eſtate of ciuill pollicie ſhould be ouerthrowen, but rather eſtabliſhed and confirmed. And therefore as he hath not wreſted the ſworde out of the hand of a Magiſtrate, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he haue a ſouldiour to wante his weapon. To the intent that the Magiſtrate, beinge armed wyth aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of lawes, might with ſeueritie of the ſame lawes, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wickednes, annoying the members and inward par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the common wealth, &amp; the ſouldiar clad in armour, might wyth dint of ſworde repell and put a ſide from the commonwealth all imminent daunger. For this cauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> neuer exhorteth men from applyinge themſelues to the knowledge of feates of armes, but preſcribeth lawes vnto ſouldiours of harmeleſſe vſage, and temperate beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. And <hi>Paule</hi> calleth thoſe magiſtrates the ſeruaunts of God which wyth the ſword puniſhe wicked and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons. Truly nothing were more hartely to bee deſired of a Chriſtian man, then that all men woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne themſelues from wickednes and ſinnefull luſte. But foraſmuche as that cannot alwayes fall oute, and in ſteede of continencie, vnbridled luſte, in ſteede of iuſtice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forraine force, or ciuil broyles vſe to aryſe, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie either the force of the ennemye is wyth weapons &amp; mayne ſtrength to be beaten backe, or the outrage of oure citizens with ſword to be repreſſed. That ſay they is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſtian charitie. As thoughe any kinde of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
<pb facs="tcp:13981:111"/> were greater then to be diſſolute and neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in a ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerall diſtreſſe and miſerie. Chryſt hath commaunded that we ſhoulde bee reuenged of our enemyes. No doubt it is the propertye of perfecte and abſolute vertue, when priuatlye wee ſuſteyne wronges and iniuryes to ſhewe a ſingular and wonderfull patience of the mynde: but when ether the common wealth and ſaftye of our countrye, or the honour &amp; eſtate of religion is impugned, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agaynſte outrage and villanye to take an inuincible ſtomach.

No doubt that peace he hath commended whiche hee himſelfe gaue vs, which doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſte in pleaſaunt reſte and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes that mannes nature is prone to deſire (for who can ſuppoſe that he hath graunted vnto vs that kynd of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye when he ſuffered his owne diſcples to be toſſed as it were with troubleſome waues of mannes outragious fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) but that peace by the which we were reconciled into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace and fauoure of God, whiche had conceyued greate wrath and indignation agaynſt vs, and to whoſe religion our wilfull aypetytes were moſte repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te.

For I woulde not haue any man ſo weake-brainde, to thincke that contrary to the will and pleaſure of Chriſte, which we know aſſuredly to haue beene don by his holye ayde and aſſiſtaunce, and to the accompliſhinge whereof it is moſt euidente that the valiaunteſt men of all haue bin with his voyce almoſt excited and ſtirred vp. For to omitte Hiſtoryes of auncient time, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ouercame <hi>Maxentius</hi> not ſo much throughe the multitude and nomber of his ſouldiars, or ſtrength of his hoſte, or his ſkill and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in warrefare, as by the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraunce and helpe of Chriſt, whom at the very firſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet he ſo terrifyed, that after a moſte ſhamefull ſort he put him to flighte, and made him ready to ſeeke his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, &amp; in the ende compelled him to drowne himſelfe in the channel of <hi>Tiber</hi> the riuer.

It would be an endleſſe laboure for mee to rehearſe in howe manye places they haue put to flight and vanquiſhed a meruaylous number of their ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies with a ſmall bande of men, howe often by moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſignes they haue perceiued that healpes and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes came downe from Heauen vnto theym, whych was playnely to bee ſeene in <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the firſt kinge of <hi>Portugale,</hi> and the chyefeſt of youre name and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13981:114"/> being rounde about it enlightened wyth a ſhyning bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wyth which ſight hee was ſo encouraged &amp; animated, that he ouerthrew and vanquiſhed fiue kinges in one day. Moreouer what ſhould I ſay of his ſonne <hi>Sanctius?</hi> whoſe other valiaunt acts at this preſente to omitte, that dede of his truly was notable, whereby he purchaſed to himſelfe a memorye of a name for euer to continue, in that, when a ſtronge and mighty armie of <hi>Moores</hi> inuaded <hi>Portugale,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paſſing along from thence they might bring vnder their iuriſdiction all the whole country of Spayne, he did not onelye abate their courage, but wyth rare &amp; ſingular va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt ſtoutenes, he broughte them vnder, and as it were maugred them together. It is needeleſſe for mee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe and ſpeake of the ages and times of other kinges, lineally deſcending of theyr race and progenie? For this truly appeareth plainely by the recordes and teſtimony of our owne Chronicles, that there was almoſt none among them all, that in his time procured not vnto himſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie prayſe and commendation, as well for his valiaunte courage, as for his pietie and godlines. Wherefore when all the worſhippers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> were with great conflict in warre ſubdued, &amp; expelled out of the king of <hi>Portugale</hi> his territorie, they ledde forth their hoſte, not ſo much for nomber as proweſſe inuincible, and inuaded the coaſtes of <hi>Affrica,</hi> wher after they had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt famous victories, and ſubdued many citties, they helde by force of armes a great part of the <hi>Moores</hi> land. Truly it is no eaſie matter to expreſſe wyth howe whote and luſtie courage our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen dealt in thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flictes, who ranne into the middeſt of their ennemies hoſte, that a man would haue thoughte they had earneſtly deſired death. For they right wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtoode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the race of this life is ſoone runne, and therefore they referred all their thoughts, to that immortall glory which is prepared for all them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> manfullye and in a good quarel depart this life. And ſo being incited &amp; prouoked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13981:115"/> that moſt aſſured hope of immortality and earneſte zeale they heare to the aduauncemente of true religyon, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes they wiſhed nothing more deſirouſly, then that they mought vowe to ſpende their fraile and ſhort lyfe (whiche ſhortly after they muſt deeds yeelde to nature) in Chrſtes quarell. So that at length it fell oute by their meanes and worckinge that all thoſe countryes which for numbre of people, and violent inuaſion mighte els haue ſwarmed and increaſed through all <hi>Spayne,</hi> were nowe ſo cutte of, that they ſtande more in feare of oure force and weapons bent agaynſt them, then wee haue any cauſe at al to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied at their fury and outrage. And to conclude, what a noble acte was this of theirs, that they ſayled ouer the greate mayne ſea wyth a wonderfull longe and fearefull nauigation, and by force of armes paſſed through almoſt al partes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Weſt, Eaſt, North, &amp; South? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould I reherſe here how they ouercame and how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mightieſt towns y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in <hi>Arabia, Perſia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia?</hi> how hardly &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what great difficulty they ended thoſe warrres wherein they ouercame <hi>India?</hi> how they diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited and put to flight on the ſeas, nauies maruaylouſlye wel furniſhed, &amp; huge and mighty hoſtes. Howe the whole Power that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Turcks</hi> were able to make about thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes was put to wrack and vtterly va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iſſance and valiauntnes of our countryemen. And are al theſe thinges (think you) of that nature, that they coulde be doone without the moſt preſt and ready healpe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God? Certes, I for my parte will neuer thinke ſo wel of the vertue and paſſing politique witt of your father <hi>Immanuel</hi> that noble Prynce for proweſſe and chiualry farre paſſing all other within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compaſſe of our memory: I will neuer ſo muche maruayle at that ſinguler forecaſt and wonderful vertu of your brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> a moſt iuſte &amp; merciful Prynce: To conclude I wil neuer be farre in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue with the ſtoutnes of our countryemen and their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13981:115"/> and naturall inclination thereunto, that I will ſuppoſe they were able to doe ſuch worthy actes by means of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome and ſtrength, but by the prouidence and mightye power of God Almighty. For oure countrimen were neuer able to ouercome neither the <hi>Moores</hi> in policie, nor the <hi>Perſians</hi> in ſtrength, nor the <hi>Turkes</hi> in chiualrye, nor the <hi>Arabians</hi> in number. And yet onely by the earneſte zeale to piety and godlines and the moſt ſincere profeſſion of Chryſtes religion which hath alwayes moſt playnlye appeared in our countriemen, they haue bene ouercomed and theire power ſcatterred. This is the onely thinge that hath encreaſed the wealth &amp; eſtate of <hi>Portugall,</hi> that hath purchaſed to our kinges &amp; princes euerlaſtinge fame and glory, and hath by longe cuſtome taughte an infinite numbre of Alians and ſtraungers to ſubmyt themſelues to their rule and dominion. But what ſhould it auayle to vſe more examples in this matter? ſeynge that nothing is more cleare &amp; euident aſwel by the teſtimonie of holye ſcripture, as alſo by a greate number of other thinges for memoryes ſake leſte in wrytyng then that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kynd of war w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſafty, or defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ſo acceptable to Chriſte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is directed by the preſent aſſiſtance of his mightye powre. Wherefore if Chriſtian religion bee no hinderaunce at al to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; exerciſe of martial affayres, but doth rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſet forth and confirme the ſame: in as much as it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away al feare and daſtardly cowardnes through the aſſured hope of immortality and maruailoſlye ſtirreth vp our myndes vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> attaining true glorye: then it foloweth by good reaſon that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtians more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous not onlye throughe the prayſe and commendation of integrity, innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, liberality, &amp; iuſtice, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they farre excede al other men in renomne of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallrye, and all other lawdable propertyes of vertue. For that is to be ſette downe as a ſure ground and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:13981:116"/> whiche was heretofore declared that, that onely is to be tearmed a vertue, whiche directeth it ſelfe vnto that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraygne good, and laſte deſired ende, for whoſe ſake al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges are to be wiſhed for: and that alſo whiche is directed and guyded by Gods holy will and pleaſure, not by mannes owne wilfull appetite and ficle phantaſie.</p>
               <p>So that it may eaſily be gathered hereby, that they neuer ſhewed any notable ſtoutnes of courage in warre whiche ſought after ſhadowes of falſe renomne, but true fame &amp; glorye the could not obtayne. Onlye they that ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chryſte beholdinge alwayes the true ende for whoſe ſake to come into perill and daunger of venturynge lyfe, &amp; limmes they think it not onely honourable, but moſt ſwete &amp; pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are in dede truely to be iudged ſtout &amp; couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and full of magnanimitie.</p>
               <p>THe concluſion of all is this, that wee ſhoulde diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, and depelye ponder with oure ſelues howe greate the dignity and maieſty is of this Chriſtian kinred whych God hym ſelfe the hyghe prynce, and ruler of all, purging the ſame from al contagio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne and impietie, hath made his by adoptyon, and hath aduaunced it to all worthy tytles of great renoume, and hath powred theron ſuch giftes as ſhalbee immortall &amp; neuer decay. Which is not li<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cked to any mortal affinitie or allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth God as an onely gouernour &amp; parent. The which Chriſte our mighty and bleſſed ſauiour hath ſo vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, that he hath imparted therewith almoſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye and heauenly indumentes.

For what thinge els in the life of man is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, highly aduanced, worthy great honour and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Nay rather what is not vnconſtant, lowe in eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vile of condicion? For whether wee reſpect the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of ritches, or the waueringe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion of honour and humayne glory, or the paynted ſhewe of kinrede and nobility: or laſtly the counterfaite and deceiptfull reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce of humaine vertue, wee ſhall finde nothinge that may fully ſatiſfy our hartes deſire, or delight our mindes with anye ſutch pleaſure as longe may continue. For all theſe thynges are vile, tranſitorye, mortall, full of errour and contemptible vanity. Onely the worthye titles of Chriſtian nobility are highly eſteemed, immortall, of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine perfection and excellency. Such as no force can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, no continuance of time drowne in the pit of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion, no kinde of calamity vtterly extinguiſhe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though mans baſe and abiect minde be in no wiſe able to aſpire vnto ſo great honour and dignity: yet they which through the healpe &amp; gratious goodnes of Chriſte haue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from the ſociety &amp; felowſhip of men &amp; are nowe adopted into the houſhoulde &amp; familye of GOD, beinge ſtaied by the helpe &amp; aſſiſtaunce of God, ſhall moſte eaſily beare and maintaine that their honourable porte.
